  <section id="Overview">
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall version 3.1, Shorewall has the capability
    to compile a Shorewall configuration and produce a runnable firewall
    program script. The script is a complete program which can be placed on a
    system with <emphasis>Shorewall Lite</emphasis> installed and can serve as
    the firewall creation script for that system.</para>

    <section id="Restrictions">
      <title>Restrictions</title>

      <para>While compiled Shorewall programs are useful in many cases, there
      are some important restrictions that you should be aware of before
      attempting to use them.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">detectnets</emphasis> interface
          option is not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>DYNAMIC_ZONES=Yes in <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> is
          not supported.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All extension scripts used are copied into the program (with
          the exception of <ulink url="shorewall_extension_scripts.htm">those
          executed a compile-time by Shorewall-perl</ulink>). The
          ramifications of this are:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>If you update an extension script, the compiled program
              will not use the updated script.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>With Shorewall 3.2.0 through 3.2.8, the
              <filename>params</filename> extension script is executed at
              compile time as well as at run time.</para>

              <para>Running the script at compile time allows variable
              expansion (expanding $variable to its defined value) of
              variables used in Shorewall configuration files to occur at
              compile time. Running it at run-time allows your extension
              scripts to use the variables that it creates. BUT -- for any
              given variable, the value at compile time may be different from
              the value at run-time unless you only assign constant
              values.</para>

              <para>For example, if you have:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(find_first_interface_address eth0)</programlisting>

              <para>in <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> then all
              occurrences of $EXT_IP in Shorewall configuration files will be
              replaced with eth0's IP address when the program is being
              compiled. On the other hand, if you use $EXT_IP in your start
              script, the value will be the IP address of eth0 when the
              program is run.</para>

              <para>Bottom line: You probably want to use only constant values
              for variables set in
              <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename>.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Beginning with Shorewall 3.2.9 and 3.4.0 RC2, the
              <filename>params</filename> file is only processed at compile
              time if you set EXPORTPARAMS=No in
              <filename>shorewall.conf</filename>. For run-time setting of
              shell variables, use the <filename>init</filename> extension
              script. Although the default setting is EXPORTPARAMS=Yes for
              compatibility, the recommended setting is
              EXPORTPARAMS=No.</para>

              <para>If the <filename>params</filename> file needs to set shell
              variables based on the configuration of the firewall system, you
              can use this trick:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(ssh root@firewall "/sbin/shorewall-lite call find_first_interface_address eth0")</programlisting>

              <para>The <command>shorewall-lite call</command> command allows
              you to to call interactively any Shorewall function that you can
              call in an extension script.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must install Shorewall Lite on the system where you want
          to run the script. You then install the compiled program in
          /usr/share/shorewall-lite/firewall and use the /sbin/shorewall-lite
          program included with Shorewall Lite to control the firewall just as
          if the full Shorewall distribution was installed.</para>

      <para>The following information applies to <emphasis

        <para>You install the full Shorewall release on one system within your

          <para>If you want to be able to allow non-root users to manage

          the files that way and you may have to change the file permissions
          yourself. /sbin/shorewall uses the SHOREWALL_SHELL setting from
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> to determine the
          shell to use when compiling programs and it uses the VERBOSITY

            <para>It is important to understand that with Shorewall Lite, the

            <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> for that
            firewall. So when the Shorewall documentation gives instructions
            for placing entries in files in the firewall's <filename
            class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename>, when using Shorewall

          <para>Also, edit the shorewall.conf file in the firewall's export
          directory and change the CONFIG_PATH setting to remove <filename
          class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename>. You can replace it with
          <filename
          class="directory">/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles</filename> if you
          like.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

            <para>Before editing:</para>

            <programlisting>CONFIG_PATH=/etc/shorewall:/usr/share/shorewall</programlisting>

            <programlisting>CONFIG_PATH=/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles:/usr/share/shorewall</programlisting>
          </blockquote>

          <para>Changing CONFIG_PATH will ensure that subsequent compilations
          using the export directory will not include any files from <filename
          class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename>.</para>

          <para>If you set variables in the params file, there are a couple of
          issues:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>With Shorewall 3.2.0 through 3.2.8, the
              <filename>params</filename> extension script is executed at
              compile time as well as at run time.</para>

              <para>Running the script at compile time allows variable
              expansion (expanding $variable to its defined value) of
              variables used in Shorewall configuration files to occur at
              compile time. Running it at run-time allows your extension
              scripts to use the variables that it creates. BUT -- for any
              given variable, the value at compile time may be different from
              the value at run-time unless you only assign constant
              values.</para>

              <para>For example, if you have:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(find_first_interface_address eth0)</programlisting>

              <para>in <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename> then all
              occurrences of $EXT_IP in Shorewall configuration files will be
              replaced with eth0's IP address when the program is being
              compiled. On the other hand, if you use $EXT_IP in your start
              script, the value will be the IP address of eth0 when the
              program is run.</para>

              <para>Bottom line: You probably want to use only constant values
              for variables set in <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename>
              or upgrade to Shorewall 3.2.9 or later (3.4.0 RC2 or
              later).</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Beginning with Shorewall 3.2.9 and 3.4.0 RC2, the
              <filename>params</filename> file is only processed at compile
              time if you set EXPORTPARAMS=No in
              <filename>shorewall.conf</filename>. For run-time setting of
              shell variables, use the <filename>init</filename> extension
              script.</para>

              <para>If the <filename>params</filename> file needs to set shell
              variables based on the configuration of the firewall system, you
              can use this trick:</para>

              <programlisting>EXT_IP=$(ssh root@firewall "/sbin/shorewall-lite call find_first_interface_address eth0")</programlisting>

              <para>The <command>shorewall-lite call</command> command allows
              you to to call interactively any Shorewall function that you can

    <para>As you can see, the file contains a simple list of shell variable
    assignments — the variables correspond to the capabilities listed by the
    <command>shorewall show capabilities</command> command and they appear in
    the same order as the output of that command.</para>

    <para>To aid in creating this file, Shorewall Lite includes a
    <command>shorecap</command> program. The program is installed in the
    <filename>/usr/share/shorewall-lite/</filename> directory and may be run
    as follows:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><command>[ IPTABLES=&lt;iptables binary&gt; ] [
      MODULESDIR=&lt;kernel modules directory&gt; ]
      /usr/share/shorewall-lite/shorecap &gt; capabilities</command></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The IPTABLES and MODULESDIR options have their <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">usual Shorewall default
    values</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The <filename>capabilities</filename> file may then be copied to a
    system with Shorewall installed and used when compiling firewall programs
    to run on the remote system.</para>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall Lite version 3.2.2, the capabilities file
    may also be creating using
    <filename>/sbin/shorewall-lite:</filename><blockquote>
        <para><command>shorewall-lite show -f capabilities &gt;
        capabilities</command></para>
      </blockquote></para>

    <para>Note that unlike the shorecap program, the <command>show
    capabilities</command> command shows the kernel's current capabilities; it
    does not attempt to load additional kernel modules.</para>
