<blockquote>      A growing  number of MTAs serving list subscribers are rejecting
  all    HTML  traffic.  At least one MTA has gone so far as to blacklist
  shorewall.net      "for  continuous abuse" because it has been my policy
  to  allow HTML in  list    posts!!<br>
                      <br>
                                               I think that blocking all
HTML   is  a  Draconian      way   to  control     spam    and  that the
ultimate   losers   here are not    the spammers    but the   list  subscribers
     whose MTAs   are bouncing    all shorewall.net    mail. As   one list 
 subscriber    wrote    to me privately      "These e-mail admin's   need 
 to get a <i>(expletive      deleted)</i>  life     instead of trying to rid
  the planet of HTML based   e-mail".   Nevertheless,       to allow subscribers
 to  receive list posts   as must as possible,   I  have   now   configured
the  list  server at shorewall.net   to strip all HTML    from  outgoing
 posts.<br>
     <br>
     <big><font color="#cc0000"><b>If you run your own outgoing mail server 
 and it doesn't have a valid DNS PTR record, your email won't reach the lists
  unless/until the postmaster notices that your posts are being rejected.
To  avoid this problem, you should configure your MTA to forward posts to
shorewall.net  through an MTA that <u>does</u> have a valid PTR record (such
as the one at your ISP). </b></font></big><br>
