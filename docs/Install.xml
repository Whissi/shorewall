          <para>Some users are in the habit of using the <command>rpm
          -U</command> command for installing packages as well as for updating
          them. If you use that command when installing the Shorewall RPM then
          you will have to manually enable Shorewall startup at boot time by
          running <command>chkconfig</command>, <command>insserv</command> or

        <note>
          <para>Shorewall is dependent on the iproute package. Unfortunately,

      <para>To allow distributions to designate alternate locations for these

    <title>General Notes about Upgrading Shorewall</title>

    <para>Most problems associated with upgrades come from two causes:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The user didn't read and follow the migration considerations in
        the release notes (these are also reproduced in the <ulink
        url="upgrade_issues.htm">Shorewall Upgrade Issues</ulink>).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The user mis-handled the
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> file during
        upgrade. Shorewall is designed to allow the default behavior of the
        product to evolve over time. To make this possible, the design assumes
        that <emphasis role="bold">you will not replace your current
        shorewall.conf</emphasis> <emphasis role="bold">file during
        upgrades</emphasis>. It is recommended that after you first install
        Shorewall that you modify
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> so as to prevent
        your package manager from overwriting it during subsequent upgrades
        (since the addition of STARTUP_ENABLED, such modification is assured
        since you must manually change the setting of that option). If you
        feel absolutely compelled to have the latest options in your
        shorewall.conf then you must proceed carefully. You should determine
        which new options have been added and you must reset their value (e.g.
        OPTION=""); otherwise, you will get different behavior from what you
        expect.</para>
