    <title>Xen Network Environment</title>

    <para><ulink
    url="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</ulink> is a
    <firstterm>paravirtualization</firstterm> tool that allows you to run
    multiple virtual machines on one physical machine. It is available on a
    wide number of platforms and is included in recent
    <trademark>SUSE</trademark> distributions.</para>

    <para>Xen refers to the virtual machines as
    <firstterm>Domains</firstterm>. Domains are numbered with the first domain
    being domain 0, the second domain 1, and so on. Domain 0
    (<firstterm>Dom0</firstterm>) is special because that is the domain
    created when the machine is booted. Additional domains (called
    <firstterm>DomU</firstterm>'s) are created using the <command>xm
    create</command> command from within Domain 0. Additional domains can also
    be created automatically at boot time by using the
    <command>xendomains</command> service.</para>

    <para>Xen virtualizes a network interface named <filename
    class="devicefile">eth0</filename><footnote>
        <para>This assumes the default Xen configuration created by
        <command>xend </command>and assumes that the host system has a single
        Ethernet interface named <filename
        class="devicefile">eth0</filename>.</para>
      </footnote>in each domain. In Dom0, Xen also creates a bridge (<filename
    class="devicefile">xenbr0</filename>) and a number of virtual interfaces
    as shown in the following diagram.</para>

    <graphic align="center" fileref="images/Xen1.png" />

    <para>I use the term <firstterm>Extended Dom0</firstterm> to distinguish
    the bridge and virtual interfaces from Dom0 itself. That distinction is
    important when we try to apply Shorewall in this environment.</para>

    <para>The bridge has a number of ports:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>peth0 — This is the port that connects to the physical network
        interface in your system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>vif0.0 — This is the bridge port that is used by traffic to/from
        Domain 0.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>vifX.0 — This is the bridge port that is used by traffic to/from
        Domain X.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section id="Before">
    <title>Before Xen</title>

    <para>Prior to adopting Xen, I had a home office crowded with 5 systems,
    three monitors a scanner and a printer. The systems were:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Firewall</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Public Server in a DMZ (mail)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Private Server (wookie)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>My personal Linux Desktop (ursa)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>My work system (docked laptop running Windows XP).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>The result was a very crowded and noisy room.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="After">
    <title>After Xen</title>

    <para>Xen has allowed me to reduce the noise and clutter considerably. I
    now have three systems with two monitors. I've also replaced the
    individual printer and scanner with a Multifunction
    FAX/Scanner/Printer.</para>

    <para>The systems now include:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Combination Firewall/Public Server/Private Server/Wireless
        Gateway using Xen (created by building out my Linux desktop
        system).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>My work system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>My Linux desktop (wookie, which is actually the old public
        server box)</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Most of the Linux systems run <trademark>SUSE </trademark>10.1; my
    personal Linux desktop system and our Linux Laptop run
    <trademark>Ubuntu</trademark> "Dapper Drake".</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">The configuration described below uses a
    bridged Xen Networking configuration; if you want to see how to accomplish
    a similar configuration using a Routed Xen configuration then please see
    <ulink url="XenMyWay-Routed.html">this article</ulink>. I am now using the
    routed configuration because it results in one fewer domains to
    administer.</emphasis></para>

    <para>Here is a high-level diagram of our network.</para>

    <graphic align="center" fileref="images/Xen5.png" />

    <para>As shown in this diagram, the Xen system has three physical network
    interfaces. These are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename> -- connected to the
        switch in my office. That switch is cabled to a second switch in my
        wife's office where my wife has her desktop and networked printer (I
        sure wish that there had been wireless back when I strung that CAT-5
        cable halfway across the house).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><filename class="devicefile">eth1</filename> -- connected to our
        DSL "Modem".</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><filename class="devicefile">eth2</filename> -- connected to a
        Wireless Access Point (WAP) that interfaces to our wireless
        network.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are three Xen domains.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Dom0 (DNS name ursa.shorewall.net) is used as a local file
        server (NFS and Samba).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The first DomU (Dom name <emphasis
        role="bold">firewall</emphasis>, DNS name gateway.shorewall.net) is
        used as our main firewall and wireless gateway.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The second DomU (Dom name <emphasis
        role="bold">lists</emphasis>, DNS name lists.shorewall.net) is used as
        a public Web/FTP/Mail/DNS server.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Shorewall runs in Dom0 and in the firewall domain.</para>

    <caution>
      <para>As the developer of Shorewall, I have enough experience to be very
      comfortable with Linux networking and Shorewall/iptables. I arrived at
      this configuration after a fair amount of trial and error
      experimentation. If you are a Linux networking novice, I recommend that
      you do not attempt a configuration like this one for your first
      Shorewall installation. You are very likely to frustrate both yourself
      and the Shorewall support team. Rather I suggest that you start with
      something simple like a <ulink url="standalone.htm">standalone
      installation</ulink> in a domU; once you are comfortable with that then
      you will be ready to try something more substantial.</para>

      <para>As Paul Gear says: <emphasis>Shorewall might make iptables easy,
      but it doesn't make understanding fundamental networking principles,
      traffic shaping, or multi-ISP routing any easier</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The same goes for Xen networking.</para>
    </caution>

    <section id="Domains">
      <title>Domain Configuration</title>

      <para>Below are the relevant configuration files for the three domains.
      I use partitions on my hard drives for DomU storage devices.</para>

      <para>With all three Xen domains up and running, the system looks as
      shown in the following diagram.</para>

      <graphic align="center" fileref="images/Xen4.png" />

      <para>The zones correspond to the Shorewall zones in the firewall DomU
      configuration.</para>

      <note>
        <para>If you want to run a simple NAT gateway in a Xen DomU, just omit
        the second bridge (xenbr1), the second delegated interface, and the
        second DomU from the above configuration. You can then install the
        <ulink url="two-interface.htm">normal Shorewall two-interface sample
        configuration</ulink> in the DomU.</para>
      </note>

      <caution>
        <para>Under some circumstances, UDP and/or TCP communication from a
        domU won't work for no obvious reason. That happened with the
        <emphasis role="bold">lists</emphasis> domain in my setup. Looking at
        the IP traffic with <command>tcpdump -nvvi eth1</command> in the
        <emphasis role="bold">firewall</emphasis> domU showed that UDP packets
        from the <emphasis role="bold">lists</emphasis> domU had incorrect
        checksums. That problem was corrected by arranging for the following
        command to be executed in the <emphasis role="bold">lists</emphasis>
        domain when its <filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename> device
        was brought up:</para>

        <para><command>ethtool -K eth0 tx off</command></para>

        <para>Under SUSE 10.1, I placed the following in
        <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/if-up.d/resettx</filename> (that file
        is executable):</para>

        <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

if [ $2 = eth0 ]; then
    ethtool -K eth0 tx off
    echo "TX Checksum reset on eth0"
fi</programlisting>

        <para>Under other distributions, the technique will vary. For example,
        under <trademark>Debian</trademark> or <trademark>Ubuntu</trademark>,
        you can just add a 'post-up' entry to
        <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> as shown here:</para>

        <programlisting> iface eth0 inet static
         address 206.124.146.177
         netmask 255.255.255.0
         post-up ethtool -K eth0 tx off</programlisting>
      </caution>

      <caution>
        <para>Update. Under SUSE 10.2, communication from a domU works okay
        without running ethtool <emphasis role="bold">but traffic shaping in
        dom0 doesn't work!</emphasis> So it's a good idea to run it just to be
        safe.</para>
      </caution>

      <para>SUSE 10.1 includes Xen 3.0.2 which supports PCI delegation. The
      network interfaces that connect to the net and wifi zones are delegated
      to the firewall DomU.</para>

      <para>When Shorewall starts during bootup of Dom0, it creates the two
      bridges using this <filename>/etc/shorewall/init</filename> extension
      script:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <programlisting>for bridge in xenbr0 xenbr1; do
    if [ -z "$(/sbin/brctl show 2&gt; /dev/null | fgrep $bridge)" ]; then
         /sbin/brctl addbr $bridge
         /sbin/ip link set dev $bridge up
   fi
done</programlisting>
      </blockquote>

    <section id="Dom0">
      <title>Dom0 Configuration</title>

      <para>The goals for the Shorewall configuration in Dom0 are as
      follows:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Allow traffic to flow unrestricted through the two bridges.
          This is done by configuring the hosts connected to each bridge as a

        <listitem>
          <para>Ensure that there is no stray traffic between the zones. This
