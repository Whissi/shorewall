    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This article will try to help you understand how packets pass
    through a firewall configured by Shorewall. You may find it useful to have
    a copy of the <ulink url="NetfilterOverview.html">Netfilter
    Overview</ulink> handy to refer to.</para>

    <para>The discussion that follows assumes that you are running a current
    kernel (2.6.20 or later) with the <ulink url="kernel.htm">recommended
    options </ulink>included. Otherwise processing may be somewhat different
    from described below depending on the features supported by your
    kernel.</para>

    <para>Where a packet is covered by steps in more than one of the following
    sections, processing occurs in the order in which the sections
    appear.</para>

    <title>Packets Entering the Firewall from Outside</title>

    <para>Certain processing occurs on packets entering the firewall from the
    outside that don't occur for packets that originate on the firewall
    itself.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The TOS field in the packet is conditionally altered based on
        the contents of your <filename>/etc/shorewall/tos</filename> file.
        This occurs in the <emphasis role="bold">pretos</emphasis> chain of
        the <emphasis>mangle</emphasis> table.</para>

        <para>Packets are marked based on the contents of your
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/mangle</filename>
        (<filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>) file and the setting of
        MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN in

      <listitem>
        <para>If the destination was not rewritten in the previous step then

        chain called <emphasis
