    <title>Background</title>

    <para>The traditional net-tools contain a program called
    <emphasis>ifconfig</emphasis> which is used to configure network devices.
    ifconfig introduced the concept of <emphasis>aliased</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>virtual</emphasis> interfaces. These virtual interfaces have
    names of the form <emphasis>interface:integer</emphasis> (e.g., <filename
    class="devicefile">eth0:0</filename>) and ifconfig treats them more or
    less like real interfaces.</para>

    <example id="ifconfig">
      <title>ifconfig</title>

      <programlisting>[root@gateway root]# <command>ifconfig eth0:0</command>
eth0:0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:00:08:3:FA:55
          inet addr:206.124.146.178  Bcast:206.124.146.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x2000
[root@gateway root]# </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>The ifconfig utility is being gradually phased out in favor of the
    <firstterm>ip</firstterm> utility which is part of the
    <emphasis>iproute</emphasis> package. The ip utility does not use the
    concept of aliases or virtual interfaces but rather treats additional
    addresses on an interface as objects in their own right. The ip utility
    does provide for interaction with ifconfig in that it allows addresses to
    be <emphasis>labeled</emphasis> where these labels take the form of
    ipconfig virtual interfaces.</para>

    <example id="ip">
      <title>ip</title>

      <programlisting>[root@gateway root]# <command>ip addr show dev eth0</command>

[root@gateway root]# </programlisting>

      <para><note>
          <para>One <emphasis role="bold">cannot</emphasis> type
          <quote><command>ip addr show dev eth0:0</command></quote> because
          <quote><filename class="devicefile">eth0:0</filename></quote> is a
          label for a particular address rather than a device name.</para>

          <programlisting>[root@gateway root]# <command>ip addr show dev eth0:0</command>
Device "eth0:0" does not exist.
[root@gateway root]#</programlisting>
        </note></para>
    </example>

    <para>The iptables program doesn't support virtual interfaces in either
    its <quote>-i</quote> or <quote>-o</quote> command options; as a
    consequence, Shorewall does not allow them to be used in the
    /etc/shorewall/interfaces file or anywhere else except as described in the
    discussion below.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="Adding">
    <title>Adding Addresses to Interfaces</title>

    <para>Most distributions have a facility for adding additional addresses
    to interfaces. If you have already used your distribution's capability to
    add your required addresses, you can skip this section.</para>

    <para>Shorewall provides facilities for automatically adding addresses to
    interfaces as described in the following section. It is also easy to add
    them yourself using the <emphasis role="bold">ip</emphasis> utility. The
    above alias was added using:</para>

    <programlisting><command>ip addr add 206.124.146.178/24 brd 206.124.146.255 dev eth0 label eth0:0</command></programlisting>

    <para>You probably want to arrange to add these addresses when the device
    is started rather than placing commands like the above in one of the
    Shorewall extension scripts. For example, on RedHat systems, you can place
    the commands in /sbin/ifup-local:</para>

    <programlisting>#!/bin/sh

case $1 in
    eth0)
        /sbin/ip addr add 206.124.146.178 dev eth0 label eth0:0
        ;;
esac</programlisting>

    <para>RedHat systems also allow adding such aliases from the network
    administration GUI (which only works well if you have a graphical
    environment on your firewall).</para>

    <para>On Debian and LEAF/Bering systems, it is as simple as adding the
    command to the interface definition as follows:</para>

    <programlisting># Internet interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 206.124.146.176
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 206.124.146.254
        <command>up ip addr add 206.124.146.178/24 brd 206.124.146.255 dev eth0 label eth0:0</command></programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="How">
    <title>So how do I handle more than one address on an interface?</title>

    <para>The answer depends on what you are trying to do with the interfaces.
    In the sub-sections that follow, we'll take a look at common
    scenarios.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The examples in the following sub-sections assume that the local
      network is 192.168.1.0/24.</para>
    </note>

    <section id="Rules">
      <title>Separate Rules</title>

      <para>If you need to make a rule for traffic to/from the firewall itself
      that only applies to a particular IP address, simply qualify the $FW
      zone with the IP address.</para>

      <example id="SSH">
        <title>allow SSH from net to eth0:0 above</title>

        <para><optional><filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename></optional><programlisting>#ACTION   SOURCE     DEST                 PROTO      DEST PORT(S)
ACCEPT    net        $FW:206.124.146.178  tcp        22</programlisting></para>
      </example>
    </section>

    <section id="DNAT">
      <title>DNAT</title>

      <para>Suppose that I had set up eth0:0 as above and I wanted to port
      forward from that virtual interface to a web server running in my local
      zone at 192.168.1.3. That is accomplished by a single rule in the
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION   SOURCE     DEST                 PROTO      DEST PORT(S)   SOURCE    ORIGINAL
#                                                                   PORT(S)   DEST
DNAT      net        loc:192.168.1.3      tcp        80             -         206.124.146.178    </programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="SNAT">
      <title>SNAT</title>

      <para>If you wanted to use eth0:0 as the IP address for outbound
      connections from your local zone (eth1), then in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>#INTERFACE             SUBNET          ADDRESS
eth0                   192.168.1.0/24  206.124.146.178</programlisting>

      <para>Similarly, you want SMTP traffic from local system 192.168.1.22 to
      have source IP 206.124.146.178:<programlisting>#INTERFACE             SUBNET          ADDRESS             PROTO      DEST PORT(S)
eth0                   192.168.1.22    206.124.146.178     tcp        25</programlisting></para>

      <para>Shorewall can create the alias (additional address) for you if you
      set ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.con</filename>f.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Addresses added by ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes are deleted and re-added
        during <command>shorewall restart</command>. As a consequence,
        connections using those addresses may be severed.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Shorewall can create the <quote>label</quote> (virtual interface)
      so that you can see the created address using ifconfig. In addition to
      setting ADD_SNAT_ALIASES=Yes, you specify the virtual interface name in
      the INTERFACE column as follows.</para>

      <para><filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename><programlisting>#INTERFACE              SUBNET         ADDRESS
eth0:0                  192.168.1.0/24 206.124.146.178</programlisting>Shorewall
      can also set up SNAT to round-robin over a range of IP addresses. To do
      that, you specify a range of IP addresses in the ADDRESS column. If you
      specify a label in the INTERFACE column, Shorewall will use that label
      for the first address of the range and will increment the label by one
      for each subsequent label.</para>

      <para><filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename><programlisting>#INTERFACE               SUBNET         ADDRESS
eth0:0                   192.168.1.0/24 206.124.146.178-206.124.146.180</programlisting></para>

      <para>The above would create three IP addresses:</para>

      <programlisting>eth0:0 = 206.124.146.178
eth0:1 = 206.124.146.179
eth0:2 = 206.124.146.180</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section id="NAT">
      <title>One-to-one NAT</title>

      <para>If you wanted to use one-to-one NAT to link <filename
      class="devicefile">eth0:0</filename> with local address 192.168.1.3, you
      would have the following in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/nat</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>#EXTERNAL          INTERFACE         INTERNAL     ALL INTERFACES    LOCAL

      <para>Shorewall can create the alias (additional address) for you if you
      set ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Addresses added by ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes are deleted and re-added
        during <command>shorewall restart</command>. As a consequence,
        connections using those addresses may be severed.</para>

      <para>Shorewall can create the <quote>label</quote> (virtual interface)
      so that you can see the created address using ifconfig. In addition to
      setting ADD_IP_ALIASES=Yes, you specify the virtual interface name in

      <para>In either case, to create rules in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> that pertain only to this NAT
      pair, you simply qualify the local zone with the internal IP
      address.</para>

    <section id="Subnets">
      <title>MULTIPLE SUBNETS</title>

      <para>Sometimes multiple IP addresses are used because there are
      multiple subnetworks configured on a LAN segment. This technique does
      not provide for any security between the subnetworks if the users of the
      systems have administrative privileges because in that case, the users
      can simply manipulate their system's routing table to bypass your
      firewall/router. Nevertheless, there are cases where you simply want to
      consider the LAN segment itself as a zone and allow your firewall/router
      to route between the two subnetworks.</para>

      <example id="subnets">
        <title>Local interface eth1 interfaces to 192.168.1.0/24 and
