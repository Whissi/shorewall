    <title>Description</title>

    <para>Entries in this file cause packets to be marked as a means of
    classifying them for traffic control or policy routing.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Unlike rules in the <ulink
      url="shorewall6-rules.html">shorewall6-rules</ulink>(5) file, evaluation
      of rules in this file will continue after a match. So the final mark for
      each packet will be the one assigned by the LAST tcrule that
      matches.</para>

      <para>If you use multiple internet providers with the 'track' option, in
      /etc/shorewall6/providers be sure to read the restrictions at <ulink
      url="http://shorewall.net/MultiISP.html">http://shorewall.net/MultiISP.html</ulink>.</para>
    </important>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.4, the tcrules file supports two
    different formats:</para>

          supported.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>FORMAT 2</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>The newer version of TPROXY is supported.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    <para>The format is specified by a line as follows:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">FORMAT {1|2}</emphasis></para>
    </blockquote>

    <para>The columns in the file are as follows (where the column name is
    followed by a different name in parentheses, the different name is used in
    the alternate specification syntax).</para>

              the range 1-255.</para>

              <para>Normally will set the mark value. If preceded by a
              vertical bar ("|"), the mark value will be logically ORed with
              the current mark value to produce a new mark value. If preceded
              by an ampersand ("&amp;"), will be logically ANDed with the
              current mark value to produce a new mark value.</para>

              <para>Both "|" and "&amp;" require Extended MARK Target support
              in your kernel and ip6tables; neither may be used with
              connection marks (see below).</para>

              <para>May optionally be followed by <emphasis

              that marking should occur in the PREROUTING chain, <emphasis
              role="bold">:F</emphasis> indicates that marking should occur in
              the FORWARD chain, <emphasis role="bold">:I </emphasis>indicates
              that marking should occur in the INPUT chain (added in Shorewall
              4.4.13) and <emphasis role="bold">:T</emphasis> indicates that
              marking should occur in the POSTROUTING chain. If neither
              <emphasis role="bold">:P</emphasis>, <emphasis
              role="bold">:F</emphasis> nor <emphasis
              role="bold">:T</emphasis> follow the mark value then the chain
              is determined as follows:</para>

              <para>- If the SOURCE is <emphasis

              role="bold">:</emphasis><emphasis>address-or-range</emphasis>[,<emphasis>address-or-range</emphasis>]...],
              then the rule is inserted into the OUTPUT chain. The behavior
              changed in Shorewall6-perl 4.1. Only high mark values may be
              assigned in this case. Packet marking rules for traffic shaping
              of packets originating on the firewall must be coded in the
              POSTROUTING chain (see below).</para>

              <para>- Otherwise, the chain is determined by the setting of
              MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN in <ulink

              included for completeness and affects neither traffic shaping
              nor policy routing.</para>

              <para>If your kernel and ip6tables include CONNMARK support then
              you can also mark the connection rather than the packet.</para>

              <para>The mark value may be optionally followed by "/" and a
              mask value (used to determine those bits of the connection mark
              to actually be set). The mark and optional mask are then

              <para>If HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes, then you may also specify a value
              in the range 0x0100-0xFF00 with the low-order byte being zero.

              256 in the OUTPUT chain when HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes. While earlier
              versions allow such values in the OUTPUT chain, it is strongly

              once a socket connection to Squid3 has been established by
              TPROXY. DIVERT marks the packet with a unique mark and exempts

              providers are configured, this can lead to problems when some of
              the connections are routed through one provider and some through
              another. The SAME target allows you to work around that problem.
              SAME may be used in the PREROUTING and OUTPUT chains. When used
              in PREROUTING, it causes matching connections from an individual
              local system to all use the same provider. For example:
              <programlisting>#ACTION           SOURCE         DEST         PROTO      DEST
#                                                        PORT(S)
SAME:P            192.168.1.0/24 0.0.0.0/0    tcp        80,443</programlisting>
              If a host in 192.168.1.0/24 attempts a connection on TCP port 80
              or 443 and it has sent a packet on either of those ports in the
              last five minutes then the new connection will use the same
              provider as the connection over which that last packet was
              sent.</para>

              <para>When used in the OUTPUT chain, it causes all matching
              connections to an individual remote system to all use the same
              provider. For example:<programlisting>#ACTION           SOURCE         DEST         PROTO      DEST
#                                                        PORT(S)
SAME              $FW            0.0.0.0/0    tcp        80,443</programlisting>
              If the firewall attempts a connection on TCP port 80 or 443 and
              it has sent a packet on either of those ports in the last five
              minutes to the same remote system then the new connection will
              use the same provider as the connection over which that last
              packet was sent.</para>
