1)  On systems running Upstart, shorewall-init cannot reliably secure
    the firewall before interfaces are brought up.

2)  An issue with params processing on RHEL6 manifested as the
    following type of warning:


       WARNING: Param line (export OLDPWD) ignored at 
                /usr/share/shorewall/Shorewall/Config.pm line
                2993.

     Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.18.1

3)  The Shorewall Lite and Shorewall6 Lite installers fail to install
    the 'helpers' modules file, with the result that both
    'shorewall[6]-lite show capabilities' and 'shorecap' fail. 

    Workaround: Copy the 'helpers' file from the Administrative System
    to the firewall system.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.18.1

4)  If an icmp or icmp6 type/code is specified in the tcfilters file, a
    run-time error occurs.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.18.1

5)  If a bridge interface has subordinate ports defined in
    /etc/shorewall/interface, then an ipsec entry (either ipsec zone or
    the 'ipsec' option specified) in /etc/shorewall/hosts results in
    the compiler generating an incorrect Netfilter configuration.

    Workaround: Change the hosts entry to specify one of the bridge
    ports. If the specified network spans more than one port, then
    replicate for each port.

    Will be corrected in Shorewall 4.4.18.2 or 4.4.19, whichever occurs
    first.
