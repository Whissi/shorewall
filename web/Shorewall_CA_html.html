    Given that I develop and support Shorewall without asking for
    any renumeration, I can hardly justify paying $200US+ a year to
    a Certificate Authority such as Thawte (A Division of VeriSign)
    for an X.509 certificate to prove that I am who I am. I have
    therefore established my own Certificate Authority (CA) and
    sign my own X.509 certificates. I use these certificates on my
    list server (<a href=
    "https://lists.shorewall.net">https://lists.shorewall.net</a>)
    which hosts parts of this web site.<br>
    <br>
    X.509 certificates are the basis for the Secure Socket Layer
    (SSL). As part of establishing an SSL session (URL
    https://...), your browser verifies the X.509 certificate
    supplied by the HTTPS server against the set of Certificate
    Authority Certificates that were shipped with your browser. It
    is expected that the server's certificate was issued by one of
    the authorities whose identities are known to your browser.
    <br>
    <br>
    This mechanism, while supposedly guaranteeing that when you
    connect to https://www.foo.bar you are REALLY connecting to
    www.foo.bar, means that the CAs literally have a license to
    print money -- they are selling a string of bits (an X.509
    certificate) for $200US+ per year!!!I <br>
    <br>
    I wish that I had decided to become a CA rather that designing
    and writing Shorewall.<br>
    <br>
    What does this mean to you? It means that the X.509 certificate
    that my server will present to your browser will not have been
    signed by one of the authorities known to your browser. If you
    try to connect to my server using SSL, your browser will frown
    and give you a dialog box asking if you want to accept the
    sleezy X.509 certificate being presented by my server. <br>
    <br>
    There are two things that you can do:<br>

    <ol>
      <li>You can accept the mail.shorewall.net certificate when
      your browser asks -- your acceptence of the certificate can
      be temporary (for that access only) or perminent.</li>

      <li>You can download and install <a href="ca.crt">my
      (self-signed) CA certificate.</a> This will make my
      Certificate Authority known to your browser so that it will
      accept any certificate signed by me.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    What are the risks?<br>

    <ol>
      <li>If you install my CA certificate then you assume that I
      am trustworthy and that Shorewall running on your firewall
      won't redirect HTTPS requests intented to go to your bank's
      server to one of my systems that will present your browser
      with a bogus certificate claiming that my server is that of
      your bank.</li>

      <li>If you only accept my server's certificate when prompted
      then the most that you have to loose is that when you connect
      to https://mail.shorewall.net, the server you are connecting
      to might not be mine.</li>
    </ol>
    I have my CA certificate loaded into all of my browsers but I
    certainly won't be offended if you decline to load it into
    yours... :-)<br>
