1)  'shorewall check' produces an internal error if 'routeback' appears
    in /etc/shorewall/routestopped.

    You can work around this problem by using 'source' rather than
    'routeback'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.2.1.

2)  'routestopped' appearing in /etc/shorewall/routestopped doesn't
    work (routeback traffic is not allowed).

    You can work around this problem by using 'source' rather than
    'routeback'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.2.2.

3)  If an alias IP address was added and RETAIN_ALIASES=No in
    shorewall.conf, a compiler internal error results.

    You can work around this problem by setting RETAIN_ALIASES=Yes in
    shorewall.conf.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.2.3.
