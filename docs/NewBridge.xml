  <section>
    <title>Background</title>

    <para>Systems where Shorewall runs normally function as
    <firstterm>routers</firstterm>. In the context of the Open System
    Interconnect (OSI) reference model, a router operates at layer 3,
    Shorewall may also be deployed on a GNU Linux System that acts as a
    <firstterm>bridge</firstterm>. Bridges are layer 2 devices in the OSI
    model (think of a bridge as an ethernet switch).</para>

    <para>Some differences between routers and bridges are:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Routers determine packet destination based on the destination IP
        address, while bridges route traffic based on the destination MAC
        address in the ethernet frame.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>As a consequence of the first difference, routers can be
        connected to more than one IP network while a bridge may be part of
        only a single network.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In most configurations, routers don't forward broadcast packets
        while a bridges do.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Section 4 of RFC 1812 describes the conditions under which a
          router may or must forward broadcasts.</para>
        </note>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Requirements</title>

    <para>Note that if you need a bridge but do not need to restrict the
    traffic through the bridge then any version of Shorewall will work. See
    the <ulink url="SimpleBridge.html">Simple Bridge documentation</ulink> for
    details.</para>

    <para>In order to use Shorewall as a bridging firewall:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Your kernel must contain bridge support (CONFIG_BRIDGE=m or
        CONFIG_BRIDGE=y).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Your kernel must contain bridge/netfilter integration
        (CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER=y).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You must have the bridge utilities (bridge-utils) package
        installed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Application</title>

    <para>The following diagram shows a typical application of a
    bridge/firewall. There is already an existing router in place whose
    internal interface supports a network, and you want to insert a firewall
    between the router, and the systems in the local network. In the example
    shown, the network uses RFC 1918 addresses but that is not a requirement;
    the bridge would work exactly the same if public IP addresses were used
    (remember that the bridge doesn't deal with IP addresses).</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/bridge.png" />

    <para>There are a several key differences in this setup and a normal
    Shorewall configuration:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Shorewall system (the Bridge/Firewall) has only a single IP
        address even though it has two ethernet interfaces! The IP address is
        configured on the bridge itself, rather than on either of the network
        cards.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The systems connected to the LAN are configured with the
        router's IP address (192.168.1.254 in the above diagram) as their
        default gateway.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>traceroute</command> doesn't detect the Bridge/Firewall
        as an intermediate router.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the router runs a DHCP server, the hosts connected to the LAN
        can use that server without having <command>dhcrelay</command> running
        on the Bridge/Firewall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <warning>
      <para>Inserting a bridge/firewall between a router and a set of local
      hosts only works if those local hosts form a single IP network. In the
      above diagram, all of the hosts in the loc zone are in the
      192.168.1.0/24 network. If the router is routing between several local
      networks through the same physical interface (there are multiple IP
      networks sharing the same LAN), then inserting a bridge/firewall between
      the router and the local LAN won't work.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>There are other possibilities here -- there could be a hub or switch
    between the router and the Bridge/Firewall and there could be other
    systems connected to that switch. All of the systems on the local side of
    the <emphasis role="bold">router</emphasis> would still be configured with
    IP addresses in 192.168.1.0/24 as shown below.<graphic
    fileref="images/bridge3.png" /></para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring the Bridge</title>

    <para>Configuring the bridge itself is quite simple and uses the
    <command>brctl</command> utility from the bridge-utils package. Bridge
    configuration information may be found at <ulink
    url="http://bridge.sf.net">http://bridge.sf.net</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately, many Linux distributions don't have good bridge
    configuration tools, and the network configuration GUIs don't detect the
    presence of bridge devices. Here is an excerpt from a Debian
    <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file for a two-port bridge
    with a static IP address:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <programlisting>auto br0
iface br0 inet static
        address 192.168.1.253
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 192.168.1.0
        broadcast 192.168.1.255
        pre-up /sbin/ip link set eth0 up
        pre-up /sbin/ip link set eth1 up
        pre-up /usr/sbin/brctl addbr br0
        pre-up /usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth0
        pre-up /usr/sbin/brctl addif br0 eth1</programlisting>
    </blockquote>

    <para>While it is not a requirement to give the bridge an IP address,
    doing so allows the bridge/firewall to access other systems and allows the
    bridge/firewall to be managed remotely. The bridge must also have an IP
    address for REJECT rules and policies to work correctly — otherwise REJECT
    behaves the same as DROP. It is also a requirement for bridges to have an
    IP address if they are part of a bridge/router.</para>

    <important>
      <para>Get your bridge configuration working first, including bridge
      startup at boot, before you configure and start Shorewall.</para>
    </important>

    <para>The bridge may have its IP address assigned via DHCP. Here's an
    example of an /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-br0 file from a
    <trademark>SUSE</trademark> system:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <programlisting>BOOTPROTO='dhcp'
REMOTE_IPADDR=''
STARTMODE='onboot'
UNIQUE='3hqH.MjuOqWfSZ+C'
WIRELESS='no'
MTU=''</programlisting>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Here's an /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0 file for a
    <trademark>Mandriva</trademark> system:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <programlisting>DEVICE=br0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes</programlisting>
    </blockquote>

    <para>On both the <trademark>SUSE</trademark> and Mandriva systems, a
    separate script is required to configure the bridge itself.</para>

    <para>Here are scripts that I used on a <trademark>SUSE</trademark> 9.1
    system.</para>

    <title>Configuring Shorewall</title>

    <para>To use this form of bridge support, you must turn off the BRIDGING
    option in <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>BRIDGING=No</programlisting>

    <para>In the scenario pictured above (where the hosts 192.168.1.10 and
    192.168.1.11 are on the 'net' side of the bridge), there would probably be
    two zones defined -- one for the internet, and one for the local LAN; so
    in <filename>/etc/shorewall/zones</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE   TYPE            OPTIONS
fw      firewall
net     ipv4
loc:net ipv4
#LAST LINE - ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS ONE - DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>Note that the <emphasis role="bold">loc</emphasis> zone is defined
    to be a sub-zone of the <emphasis role="bold">net</emphasis> zone.</para>

    <para>A conventional two-zone policy file is appropriate here —
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/policy</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#SOURCE     DEST        POLICY        LOG       LIMIT:BURST
loc         net         ACCEPT
net         all         DROP          info
all         all         REJECT        info
#LAST LINE - ADD YOUR ENTRIES ABOVE THIS ONE - DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>Only the bridge device itself is configured with an IP address, so
    only that device is defined to Shorewall in
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE    INTERFACE      BROADCAST       OPTIONS
net      br0             192.168.1.255
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>The <emphasis role="bold">loc</emphasis> zone is defined using the
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/hosts</filename> file. Assuming that the router
    is connected to <filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename> and the
    switch to <filename class="devicefile">eth1</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#ZONE           HOST(S)                         OPTIONS
loc             br0:192.168.1.0/24!192.168.1.10/31,192.168.1.254
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS LINE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <note>
      <para>192.168.1.10/31 consists of the two local systems outside the
      firewall; namely, 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.11. Those systems must be
      excluded from the <emphasis role="bold">loc</emphasis> zone as must the
      router (192.168.1.254).</para>
    </note>

    <para>When Shorewall is stopped, you want to allow only local traffic
    through the bridge —
    <filename><filename>/etc/shorewall/routestopped</filename></filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>#INTERFACE      HOST(S)         OPTIONS
br0             192.168.1.0/24  routeback
#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> file from the
    two-interface sample is a good place to start for defining a set of
    firewall rules.</para>
