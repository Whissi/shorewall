        <para>Please remember we only know what is posted in your message. Do
        not leave out any information that appears to be correct, or was

        help you. Follow good, courteous practices in writing and formatting
        your e-mail. Provide details that we need if you expect good answers.
        Exact quoting of error messages, log entries, command output, and
        other output is better than a paraphrase or summary.</para>

        <para>Please give details about what doesn't work. Reports that say
        <quote>I followed the directions and it didn't work</quote> may elicit
        sympathy but probably little in the way of help. Again -- if ping from
        A to B fails, say so (and see below for information about reporting
        <quote>ping</quote> problems). If Computer B doesn't show up in
        <quote>Network Neighborhood</quote> then say so. If access by IP

    <title>When using the mailing list, please post in plain text</title>

    <para>A growing number of MTAs serving list subscribers are rejecting all
    HTML traffic. At least one MTA has gone so far as to blacklist
    shorewall.net <quote>for continuous abuse</quote> because it has been my
    policy to allow HTML in list posts!!</para>

    <para>I think that blocking all HTML is a Draconian way to control spam
    and that the ultimate losers here are not the spammers but the list
    subscribers whose MTAs are bouncing all shorewall.net mail. As one list
    subscriber wrote to me privately <quote>These e-mail admin's need to get a
    (expletive deleted) life instead of trying to rid the planet of HTML based
    e-mail</quote>. Nevertheless, to allow subscribers to receive list posts
    as must as possible, I have now configured the list server at
    shorewall.net to convert all HTML to plain text. Sometimes the conversion
    process fails in which case, the post sent to the list is empty. Even when
    conversion succeeds, the converted post is difficult to read so all of us
    will appreciate it if you just post in plain text to begin with.</para>
