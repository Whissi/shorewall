1)  In all versions of Shorewall6 lite, the 'shorecap' program is
    using the 'iptables' program rather than the 'ip6tables' program.
    This causes many capabilities that are not available in IPv6 to
    be incorrectly reported as available.

    This results in errors such as:

    	 ip6tables-restore v1.4.2: Couldn't load match `addrtype':
	   /lib/xtables/libip6t_addrtype.so: cannot open shared
	   object file: No such file or directory

    To work around this problem, on the administrative system:

    a)  Remove the incorrect capabilties file.
    b)  In shorewall6.conf, set the IP6TABLES option to the
        path name of ip6tables on the firewall (example:
	IP6TABLES=/sbin/ip6tables).
    c)  'shorewall6 load <firewall>'.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

2)  In a number of cases, Shorewall6 generates incorrect rules
    involving the IPv6 multicast network. The rules specify
    ff00::/10 where they should specify ff00::/8.  Also, rules
    instantiated when the IPv6 firewall is stopped use ff80::/10 rather
    than fe80::/10 (IPv6 link local network).

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

3)  Using a destination port-range with :random produces a fatal
    compilation error in REDIRECT rules unless the firewall zone is
    explicitly specified (e.g., $FW::2000-2010:random).

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

4)  /sbin/shorewall and /sbin/shorewall6 sometimes fail to honor the
    'nolock' option. In other cases, this option is incorrectly passed
    on to the compiled script, causing the script to issue a usage
    synopsis and to terminate.
 
    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.1

5)  On systems that use the Upstart init system (such as Ubuntu and
    Fedora), Shorewall-init is not reliable at starting the firewall
    during boot when normal firewall startup is disabled and UPDOWN=1
    is specified in /etc/default/shorewall-init.

    Suggested workaround is to not disable normal startup (e.g., do not
    set startup=0 on Debian-based systems and do not 'checkconfig
    --del...' on Fedora).

6)  A typo in /sbin/shorewall6-lite version 4.4.11.1 causes the
    stop, reset and clear commands to hang for one minute after the
    command had been executed and causes the next shorewall6-lite
    command to similarly hang for one minute.

    Corrected in Shorewall 4.4.11.2.
