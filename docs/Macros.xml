    <title>Overview of Shorewall Macros?</title>

    <para>Shorewall macros allow a symbolic name to be associated with a
    series of one or more iptables rules. The symbolic name may appear in the
    ACTION column of an <filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-rules.html">/etc/shorewall/rules</ulink></filename>
    file entry and in the TARGET column of an action in which case, the
    traffic matching that rules file entry will be passed to the series of
    iptables rules named by the macro.</para>

    <para>Macros can be thought of as templates. When a macro is invoked in an
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> entry, it may be qualified by a
    logging specification (log level and optionally a log tag). The presence
    of the log level/tag causes a modified series of rules to be generated in
    which each packet/rule match within the macro causes a log message to be
    generated.</para>

    <para>There are two types of Shorewall macros:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Standard Macros. These macros are released as part of Shorewall.
        They are defined in macros.* files in <filename
        class="directory">/usr/share/shorewall</filename>. Each
        <filename>macros.*</filename> file has a comment at the beginning of
        the file that describes what the macro does. As an example, here is
        the definition of the <firstterm>SMB</firstterm> standard
        macro.</para>

        <programlisting>#
# Shorewall 3.0 /usr/share/shorewall/macro.SMB

#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

        <para>If you wish to modify one of the standard macros, do not modify
        the definition in /usr/share/shorewall. Rather, copy the file to
        <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> (or somewhere
        else on your CONFIG_PATH) and modify the copy.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>User-defined Macros. These macros are created by end-users. They
        are defined in macros.* files in /etc/shorewall or in another
        directory listed in your CONFIG_PATH (defined in <ulink
        url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</ulink>).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Most Standard Macros are <firstterm>parameterized</firstterm>. That
    means that you specify what you want to do (ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, etc.)
    when you invoke the macro. The SMB macro shown above is parameterized
    (note PARAM in the TARGET column).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Shorewall versions prior to 4.2.0:</emphasis>
    When invoking a parameterized macro, you follow the name of the macro with
    a slash ("/") and the action that you want to substitute for PARAM.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>/etc/shorewall/rules:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION      SOURCE        DEST         PROTO   DEST PORT(S)
SMB/ACCEPT   loc           fw         </programlisting>

      <para>The above is equivalent to coding the following series of
      rules:</para>

      <programlisting>#TARGET      SOURCE        DEST         PROTO   DEST PORT(s)
ACCEPT       loc           fw           udp     135,445
ACCEPT       loc           fw           udp     137:139
ACCEPT       loc           fw           udp     1024:   137
ACCEPT       loc           fw           tcp     135,139,445</programlisting>
    </blockquote>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Shorewall-perl versions 4.2.0 and
    later:</emphasis> When invoking a parameterized macro, you follow the name
    of the macro with the action that you want to substitute for PARAM
    enclosed in parentheses. The older syntax described above is still
    supported but is deprecated.</para>

    <para>Logging is covered in <link linkend="Logging">a following
    section</link>. The other columns are treated as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>SOURCE and DEST</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>If a value other than "-" appears in both the macro body and
          in the invocation of the macro, then the value in the invocation is
          examined and the appropriate action is taken (you will want to be
          running Shorewall 3.0.1 or later). If the value in the invocation
          appears to be an address (IP or MAC) or the name of an ipset, then
          it is placed after the value in the macro body. Otherwise, it is

  <section id="Default">
    <title>Default Macros</title>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall release 3.4, Shorewall supports
    <firstterm>default macros</firstterm>; default macros perform the same
    function as <ulink url="???">default actions</ulink>. The DEFAULT_ACCEPT,
    DEFAULT_REJECT, DEFAULT_DROP and DEFAULT_QUEUE options in
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> may specify the name of
    a macro. In that case, the rules in the macro will be traversed before the
    associated policy is applied.</para>

    <para>The value of the …_DEFAULT settings is interpreted as follows. If
    USE_ACTIONS=Yes in shorewall.conf, then the value is treated like the name
    of an action -- if that action is not found, then the value is treated
    like the name of a macro. If USE_ACTIONS=No, then the value is treated
    like the name of a macro. The special value "none" is always interpreted
    as "no default rules should be applied".</para>

    <para>Shorewall versions 3.4 and later include standard 'Reject' and
    'Drop' macros that are equivalent to the 'Reject' and 'Drop'
    actions.</para>

          <member>NONAT - Excludes the connection from any subsequent DNAT[-]

          <member>DROP - ignore the request</member>

          <member>REJECT - disallow the request and return an icmp unreachable

          <member>DNAT - Forward the request to another address (and
          optionally another port).</member>

    <para>Specifying a log level in a rule that invokes a user- or

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When you invoke a macro and specify a log level, only those

    <title>How do I know if I should create an Action or a Macro?</title>

    <para>While actions and macros perform similar functions, in any given
    case you will generally find that one is more appropriate than the
    other.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>You can not associate an Extension Script with a macro <ulink
        url="Actions.html#Extension">the way that you can with an
        Action</ulink>. So if you need access to iptables features not
        directly supported by Shorewall then you must use an action.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Macros are expanded in-line while each action is its own chain.
        So if there are a lot of rules involved in your new action/macro then
        it is generally better to use an action than a macro. Only the packets
        selected when you invoke the action are directed to the corresponding
        chain. On the other hand, if there are only one or two rules involved
        in what you want to do then a macro is more efficient.</para>
