      <title>(FAQ 1) I want to forward UDP port 7777 to my personal PC with IP
      address 192.168.1.5. I've looked everywhere and can't find how to do
      it.</title>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> The format of a

      <para>So to forward UDP port 7777 to internal system 192.168.1.5, the

      <programlisting>#ACTION    SOURCE   DEST             PROTO    DEST PORT
DNAT       net      loc:192.168.1.5  udp      7777</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to forward requests directed to a particular address (
      <emphasis>external-IP</emphasis> ) on your firewall to an internal
      system:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION SOURCE DEST                                   PROTO       DEST PORT     SOURCE  ORIGINAL

      <para>If you want to forward requests from a particular Internet address
      ( <emphasis>address</emphasis> ):</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION SOURCE        DEST                                   PROTO       DEST PORT     SOURCE  ORIGINAL

      <para>Finally, if you need to forward a range of ports, in the DEST PORT

            <para>16.105.221.4 sends a TCP SYN packet to 206.124.146.176

          <listitem>
            <para>The Shorewall box rewrites the destination IP address to
            192.168.1.4 and forwards the packet.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The FTP server receives the packet and accepts the
            connection, generating a SYN,ACK packet back to 16.105.221.4.
            Because the server's default gateway is through the second router,
            it sends the packet to that router.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>At this point, one of two things can happen. Either the second
        router discards or rejects the packet; or, it rewrites the source IP
        address to 130.252.100.109 and forwards the packet back to
        16.105.221.4. Regardless of which happens, the connection is doomed.
        Clearly if the packet is rejected or dropped, the connection will not
        be successful. But even if the packet reaches 16.105.221.4, that host
        will reject it since it's SOURCE IP address (130.252.100.109) doesn't
        match the DESTINATION IP ADDRESS (206.124.146.176) of the original SYN
        packet.</para>

        <para>The best way to work around this problem is to change the
        default gateway on the FTP server to the Shorewall system's internal
        IP address (192.168.1.1). But if that isn't possible, you can work
        around the problem with the following ugly hack in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename>:<programlisting>#INTERFACE              SOURCE             ADDRESS            PROTO         PORT

        <para>This rule has the undesirable side effect of making all FTP
        connections from the net appear to the FTP server as if they
        originated on the Shorewall system. But it will force the FTP server
        to reply back through the Shorewall system who can then rewrite the
        SOURCE IP address in the responses properly.</para>

      <title>(FAQ 30) I'm confused about when to use DNAT rules and when to
      use ACCEPT rules.</title>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> It would be a good idea
      to review the <ulink url="shorewall_quickstart_guide.htm">QuickStart
      Guide</ulink> appropriate for your setup; the guides cover this topic in
      a tutorial fashion. DNAT rules should be used for connections that need
      to go the opposite direction from SNAT/MASQUERADE. So if you masquerade
      or use SNAT from your local network to the Internet then you will need
      to use DNAT rules to allow connections from the Internet to your local
      network.<note>
          <para>If you use both 1:1 NAT and SNAT/MASQUERADE, those connections
          that are subject to 1:1 NAT should use ACCEPT rather than DNAT.
          Note, however, that DNAT can be used to override 1:1 NAT so as to
          redirect a connection to a different internal system or port than
          would be the case using 1:1 NAT.</para>
        </note> You also want to use DNAT rules when you intentionally want to
      rewrite the destination IP address or port number. In all other cases,
      you use ACCEPT unless you need to hijack connections as they go through
      your firewall and handle them on the firewall box itself; in that case,
      you use a REDIRECT rule.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The preceding answer should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be
        interpreted to mean that DNAT can only be used in conjunction with
        SNAT. But in common configurations using private local addresses, that

          internal systems. For the cost of another NIC and a cross-over
          cable, you can put your server in a DMZ such that it is isolated
          from your local systems - assuming that the Server can be located
          near the Firewall, of course :-)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The accessibility problem is best solved using

      <para>So the best and most secure way to solve this problem is to move

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer</emphasis>: No, that is not correct.
      The LOGFILE setting tells Shorewall where to find the log; it does not

      <title>(FAQ 6) Where are the log messages written and how do I change

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> NetFilter uses the
      kernel's equivalent of syslog (see <quote>man syslog</quote>) to log
      messages. It always uses the LOG_KERN (kern) facility (see <quote>man
      openlog</quote>) and you get to choose the log level (again, see
      <quote>man syslog</quote>) in your <filename><ulink
      url="manpages/shorewall-policy.html">policies</ulink></filename> and
      <filename><ulink
      url="manpages/shorewall-rules.html">rules</ulink></filename>. The
      destination for messages logged by syslog is controlled by
      <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename> (see <quote>man
      syslog.conf</quote>). When you have changed
      <filename>/etc/syslog.conf</filename>, be sure to restart syslogd (on a
      RedHat system, <quote>service syslog restart</quote>).</para>

      <title>(FAQ 16) Shorewall is writing log messages all over my console
      making it unusable!</title>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis></para>

      <para>Just to be clear, it is not Shorewall that is writing all over
      your console. Shorewall issues a single log message during each
      <command>start</command>, <command>restart</command>,
      <command>stop</command>, etc. It is rather your logging daemon that is
      writing messages to your console. Shorewall itself has no control over
      where a particular class of messages are written. See the <ulink
      url="shorewall_logging.html">Shorewall logging
      documentation</ulink>.</para>

      <para>The max log level to be sent to the console is available in
      /proc/sys/kernel/printk:<programlisting>teastep@ursa:~$ <emphasis
            role="bold">cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk</emphasis>
6      6       1       7
teastep@ursa:~$ </programlisting>The first number determines the maximum log
      level (syslog priority) sent to the console. Messages with priority
      <emphasis role="bold">less than</emphasis> this number are sent to the
      console. On the system shown in the example above, priorities 0-5 are
      sent to the console. Since Shorewall defaults to using 'info' (6), the
      Shorewall-generated Netfilter rule set will generate log messages that
      <emphasis role="bold">will not appear on the console.</emphasis></para>

      <para>The second number is the default log level for kernel printk()
      calls that do not specify a log level.</para>

      <para>The third number specifies the minimum console log level while the
      fourth gives the default console log level.</para>

      <para>If, on your system, the first number is 7 or greater, then the
      default Shorewall configurations will cause messages to be written to
      your console. The simplest solution is to add this to your
      <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> file:<programlisting>kernel.printk = 4 4 1 7</programlisting></para>

      <para>then<programlisting><command>sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf</command></programlisting></para>

      <section id="faq16b">
        <title>(FAQ 16b) Why can't I see any Shorewall messages in
        /var/log/messages?</title>

        <para>Some people who ask this question report that the only Shorewall
        messages that they see in <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> are
        'started', 'restarted' and 'stopped' messages.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> First of all, it is
        important to understand that Shorewall itself does not control where
        Netfilter log messages are written. The LOGFILE setting in
        <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> simply tells the
        <filename>/sbin/shorewall[-lite]</filename> program where to look for
        the log. Also, it is important to understand that a log level of
        "debug" will generally cause Netfilter messages to be written to fewer
        files in <filename class="directory">/var/log</filename> than a log
        level of "info". The log level does not control the number of log
        messages or the content of the messages.</para>

        <para>The actual log file where Netfilter messages are written is not
        standardized and will vary by distribution and distribution version.
        But anytime you see no logging, it's time to look outside the
        Shorewall configuration for the cause. As an example, recent
        <trademark>SUSE</trademark> releases use syslog-ng by default and
        write Shorewall messages to
        <filename>/var/log/firewall</filename>.</para>

      internal LAN</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> First of all, please note
      that the above is a very specific type of log message dealing with ICMP
      port unreachable packets (PROTO=ICMP TYPE=3 CODE=3). Do not read this
      answer and assume that all Shorewall log messages have something to do
      with ICMP (hint -- see <link linkend="faq17">FAQ 17</link>).</para>

      <para>While most people associate the Internet Control Message Protocol
      (ICMP) with <quote>ping</quote>, ICMP is a key piece of IP. ICMP is used
      to report problems back to the sender of a packet; this is what is
      happening here. Unfortunately, where NAT is involved (including SNAT,
      DNAT and Masquerade), there are many broken implementations. That is
      what you are seeing with these messages. When Netfilter displays these
      messages, the part before the "[" describes the ICMP packet and the part
      between the "[" and "]" describes the packet for which the ICMP is a
      response.</para>

      <para>Here is my interpretation of what is happening -- to confirm this
      analysis, one would have to have packet sniffers placed a both ends of
      the connection.</para>

      <para>Host 172.16.1.10 behind NAT gateway 206.124.146.179 sent a UDP DNS
      query to 192.0.2.3 and your DNS server tried to send a response (the
      response information is in the brackets -- note source port 53 which
      marks this as a DNS reply). When the response was returned to to
      206.124.146.179, it rewrote the destination IP TO 172.16.1.10 and
      forwarded the packet to 172.16.1.10 who no longer had a connection on
      UDP port 2857. This causes a port unreachable (type 3, code 3) to be
      generated back to 192.0.2.3. As this packet is sent back through
      206.124.146.179, that box correctly changes the source address in the
      packet to 206.124.146.179 but doesn't reset the DST IP in the original
      DNS response similarly. When the ICMP reaches your firewall (192.0.2.3),
      your firewall has no record of having sent a DNS reply to 172.16.1.10 so
      this ICMP doesn't appear to be related to anything that was sent. The
      final result is that the packet gets logged and dropped in the all2all
      chain.</para>

      <para>It is important to understand that the scripts in <filename

      distribution and not by the Shorewall developers. These scripts must
      meet the requirements of the distribution's packaging system which may
      conflict with the requirements of a tight firewall. So when you say
      "…when I stop Shorewall…" it is necessary to distinguish between the

      <command>/etc/init.d/shorewall stop</command>.</para>

      <title>(FAQ 90) Shorewall starts fine but after several minutes, it
      stops. Why is it doing that?</title>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> Shorewall uses the
      presence of a chain named <emphasis>shorewall</emphasis> to indicate
      whether is started or stopped. That chain is created during execution of
      a successful <emphasis role="bold">start</emphasis>, <emphasis
      role="bold">restart</emphasis> or <emphasis
      role="bold">restore</emphasis> command and is removed during <emphasis
      role="bold">stop</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">clear</emphasis>.
      If <emphasis role="bold">shorewall status</emphasis> indicates that
      Shorewall is stopped, then something has deleted that chain. Look at the
      output of <emphasis role="bold">shorewall status</emphasis>; if it looks
      like this:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <programlisting>gateway:~# shorewall status
Shorewall-4.4.11 Status at gateway - Wed Jul 21 13:21:41 PDT 2010

Shorewall is <emphasis role="bold">stopped</emphasis>
State:<emphasis role="bold">Started</emphasis> (Tue Jul 20 16:01:49 PDT 2010)

gateway:~#</programlisting>
      </blockquote>

      <para>then it means that something outside of Shorewall has deleted the
      chain. This usually means that you were running another firewall package
      before you installed Shorewall and that other package has replaced
      Shorewall's Netfilter configuration with its own. You must remove (or at
      least disable) the other firewall package and restart Shorewall.</para>

      <blockquote>
        <programlisting>gateway:~# shorewall status
Shorewall-4.4.11 Status at gateway - Wed Jul 21 13:26:29 PDT 2010

Shorewall is <emphasis role="bold">stopped</emphasis>
State:<emphasis role="bold">Stopped</emphasis> (Wed Jul 21 13:26:26 PDT 2010)

gateway:~# </programlisting>
      </blockquote>

      <para>then a <emphasis role="bold">shorewall stop</emphasis> command has
      been executed (if the State shown in the output is <emphasis
      role="bold">Cleared</emphasis>, then a <emphasis role="bold">shorewall
      clear</emphasis> command was executed). Most likely, you have installed

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> The Multi-ISP
      Documentation strongly recommends that you use the <emphasis
      role="bold">balance</emphasis> option on all providers even if you want
      to manually specify which ISP to use. If you don't do that so that your
      main routing table only has one default route, then you must disable
      route filtering. Do not specify the <emphasis
      role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option on the other interface(s) in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> and disable any
      <emphasis>IP Address Spoofing</emphasis> protection that your

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> Suppose that you want all
      traffic to go out through ISP1 (mark 1) unless you specify otherwise.
      Then simply add these two rules as the first marking rules in your

      <para>Now any traffic that isn't marked by one of your other MARK rules

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> Shorewall implements a
        stateful firewall which requires connection tracking be present in
        ip6tables and in the kernel. Linux kernels before 2.6.20 didn't
        support connection tracking for IPv6. So we could not even start to
        develop Shorewall IPv6 support until 2.6.20 and there were significant
        problems with the facility until at least kernel 2.6.23. When
        distributions began offering IPv6 connection tracking support, it was
        with kernel 2.6.25. So that is what we developed IPv6 support on and
        that's all that we initially tested on. Subsequently, we have tested
        Shorewall6 on Ubuntu Hardy with kernel 2.6.24. If you are running
        2.6.20 or later, you can <emphasis role="bold">try</emphasis> to run
        Shorewall6 by hacking<filename>
        /usr/share/shorewall/prog.footer6</filename> and changing the kernel
        version test to check for your kernel version rather than 2.6.24
        (20624). But after that, you are on your own.</para>

      <title>(FAQ 39) How do I block connections to a particular domain
      name?</title>

      <para>I tried this rule to block Google's Adsense that you'll find on
      everyone's site. Adsense is a Javascript that people add to their Web
      pages. So I entered the rule:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION   SOURCE        DEST                                 PROTO
REJECT    fw            net:pagead2.googlesyndication.com    all</programlisting>

      <para>However, this also sometimes restricts access to "google.com". Why
      is that? Using dig, I found these IPs for domain
      googlesyndication.com:<programlisting>216.239.37.99
216.239.39.99</programlisting>And this for google.com:<programlisting>216.239.37.99
216.239.39.99
216.239.57.99</programlisting>So my guess is that you are not actually
      blocking the domain, but rather the IP being called. So how in the world
      do you block an actual domain name?</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Answer:</emphasis> Packet filters like
      Netfilter base their decisions on the contents of the various protocol
      headers at the front of each packet. Stateful packet filters (of which
      Netfilter is an example) use a combination of header contents and state
      created when the packet filter processed earlier packets. Netfilter (and
      Shorewall's use of Netfilter) also consider the network interface(s)
      where each packet entered and/or where the packet will leave the
      firewall/router.</para>

      <para>When you specify <ulink
      url="configuration_file_basics.htm#dnsnames">a domain name in a
      Shorewall rule</ulink>, the iptables program resolves that name to one
      or more IP addresses and the actual Netfilter rules that are created are
      expressed in terms of those IP addresses. So the rule that you entered
      was equivalent to:</para>

      <para><programlisting>#ACTION   SOURCE        DEST                 PROTO
REJECT    fw            net:216.239.37.99    all
REJECT    fw            net:216.239.39.99    all</programlisting>Given that
      name-based multiple hosting is a common practice (another example:
      lists.shorewall.net and www1.shorewall.net are both hosted on the same
      system with a single IP address), it is not possible to filter
      connections to a particular name by examination of protocol headers
      alone. While some protocols such as <ulink url="FTP.html">FTP</ulink>
      require the firewall to examine and possibly modify packet payload,
      parsing the payload of individual packets doesn't always work because
      the application-level data stream can be split across packets in
      arbitrary ways. This is one of the weaknesses of the 'string match'
      Netfilter extension available in later Linux kernel releases. The only
      sure way to filter on packet content is to proxy the connections in
      question -- in the case of HTTP, this means running something like
      <ulink url="Shorewall_Squid_Usage.html">Squid</ulink>. Proxying allows
      the proxy process to assemble complete application-level messages which
      can then be accurately parsed and decisions can be made based on the
      result.</para>
