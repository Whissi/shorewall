    <para>Setting up a Linux system as a firewall for a small network is a
    fairly straight-forward task if you understand the basics and follow the
    documentation.</para>

    <para>This guide doesn't attempt to acquaint you with all of the features
    of Shorewall. It rather focuses on what is required to configure Shorewall
    in its most common configuration:</para>

      <para>Shorewall requires that you have the

      (on <trademark>RedHat</trademark>, the package is called

      by the presence of an <command>ip</command> program on your firewall
      system. As <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, you can use
      the <command>which</command> command to check for this program:
      <programlisting>[root@gateway root]# <command>which ip</command>
/sbin/ip
[root@gateway root]#</programlisting> I recommend that you first read through
      the guide to familiarize yourself with what's involved then go back
      through it again making your configuration changes.</para>

              skeletons may be found on your system in the directory <filename
              class="directory">/usr/share/doc/shorewall/default-config</filename>.
              Simply copy the files you need from that directory to <filename

        </orderedlist>
      </important></para>

    <para>As each file is introduced, I suggest that you look at the actual
    file on your system and that you look at the <ulink
    url="configuration_file_basics.htm#Manpages">man page</ulink> for that
    file. For example, to look at the man page for the
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/zones</filename> file, type <command>man
    shorewall-zones</command> at a shell prompt.</para>

    <para>Note: Beginning with Shorewall 4.4.20.1, there are versions of the
    sample files that are annotated with the corresponding manpage contents.
    These files have names ending in '.annotated'. You might choose to look at
    those files instead.</para>

    <para>Shorewall views the network where it is running as being composed of
    a set of zones. In the two-interface sample configuration, the following
    zone names are used:</para>

    <para><programlisting>#ZONE   TYPE     OPTIONS                 IN                      OUT
#                                        OPTIONS                 OPTIONS
fw      firewall
net     ipv4
loc     ipv4</programlisting>Zones are defined in the <ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-zones.html"><filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>zones</filename></ulink>
    file.</para>

    <para>Note that Shorewall recognizes the firewall system as its own zone -
    when the /etc/shorewall/zones file is processed, the name of the firewall
    zone is stored in the shell variable $FW which may be used to refer to the
    firewall zone throughout the Shorewall configuration.</para>

    <para>Rules about what traffic to allow and what traffic to deny are
    expressed in terms of zones. <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>You express your default policy for connections from one zone
          to another zone in the <ulink

          file.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist> For each connection request entering the firewall, the
    request is first checked against the <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>rules</filename>
    file. If no rule in that file matches the connection request then the
    first policy in <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>policy</filename>
    that matches the request is applied. If there is a <ulink
    url="shorewall_extension_scripts.htm">common action</ulink> defined for
    the policy in <filename>/etc/shorewall/actions</filename> or
    <filename>/usr/share/shorewall/actions.std</filename> then that action is
    performed before the action is applied. The purpose of the common action
    is two-fold:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>It silently drops or rejects harmless common traffic that would
        otherwise clutter up your log — Broadcasts for example.</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>policy</filename>
    file included with the two-interface sample has the following policies:

all        all         REJECT      info</programlisting>In the two-interface
    sample, the line below is included but commented out. If you want your
    firewall system to have full access to servers on the Internet, uncomment
    that line. <programlisting>#SOURCE    DEST        POLICY      LOG LEVEL    LIMIT:BURST

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist> The word <firstterm>info</firstterm> in the LOG LEVEL
    column for the DROP and REJECT policies indicates that packets dropped or
    rejected under those policies should be <ulink
    url="shorewall_logging.html">logged at that level</ulink>.</para>

    <para>It is important to note that Shorewall policies (and rules) refer to
    <emphasis role="bold">connections</emphasis> and not packet flow. With the
    policies defined in the <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/policy</filename> file shown above,
    connections are allowed from the <emphasis>loc</emphasis> zone to the
    <emphasis>net</emphasis> zone even though connections are not allowed from
    the <emphasis>loc</emphasis> zone to the firewall itself.</para>

    <para>Some people want to consider their firewall to be part of their
    local network from a security perspective. If you want to do this, add
    these two policies:</para>

    <programlisting>#SOURCE    DEST        POLICY      LOG LEVEL    LIMIT:BURST
loc        $FW         ACCEPT
$FW        loc         ACCEPT</programlisting>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif" format="GIF" /></para>

    <para>At this point, edit your <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>policy</filename>
    and make any changes that you wish.</para>

    <para>The firewall has two network interfaces. Where Internet connectivity
    is through a cable or <acronym>DSL</acronym> <quote>Modem</quote>, the
    <emphasis>External Interface</emphasis> will be the Ethernet adapter that
    is connected to that <quote>Modem</quote> (e.g., <filename
    class="devicefile">eth0</filename>) unless you connect via
    <emphasis>Point-to-Point Protocol</emphasis> over Ethernet
    (<acronym>PPPoE</acronym>) or <emphasis>Point-to-Point Tunneling
    Protocol</emphasis> (<acronym>PPTP</acronym>) in which case the External
    Interface will be a <literal>ppp</literal> interface (e.g., <filename
    class="devicefile">ppp0</filename>). If you connect via a regular modem,
    your External Interface will also be <filename
    class="devicefile">ppp0</filename>. If you connect via
    <acronym>ISDN</acronym>, your external interface will be <filename
    class="devicefile">ippp0</filename>.</para>

    <caution>
      <para>Be sure you know which interface is your external interface. Many
      hours have been spent floundering by users who have configured the wrong
      interface. If you are unsure, then as root type <command>ip route
      ls</command> at the command line. The device listed in the last
      (default) route should be your external interface.</para>

      <para>Example:</para>

      <programlisting>root@lists:~# ip route ls

  <section id="Addresses">
    <title>IP Addresses</title>

    <para>Before going further, we should say a few words about Internet
    Protocol (<acronym>IP</acronym>) addresses. Normally, your
    <acronym>ISP</acronym> will assign you a single Public IP address. This
    address may be assigned via the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (<acronym>DHCP</acronym>) or as part of establishing your connection when
    you dial in (standard modem) or establish your <acronym>PPP</acronym>
    connection. In rare cases, your <acronym>ISP</acronym> may assign you a
    static <acronym>IP</acronym> address; that means that you configure your
    firewall's external interface to use that address permanently. However
    your external address is assigned, it will be shared by all of your
    systems when you access the Internet. You will have to assign your own
    addresses in your internal network (the Internal Interface on your
    firewall plus your other computers). <emphasis role="bold">RFC
    1918</emphasis> reserves several <emphasis>Private</emphasis>
    <acronym>IP</acronym> address ranges for this purpose: <programlisting>10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</programlisting>You will want to assign your
    addresses from the same sub-network (subnet). For our purposes, we can
    consider a subnet to consists of a range of addresses <varname>x.y.z.0 -
    x.y.z.255</varname>. Such a subnet will have a Subnet Mask of <systemitem
    class="netmask">255.255.255.0</systemitem>. The address
    <varname>x.y.z.0</varname> is reserved as the <emphasis>Subnet
    Address</emphasis> and <varname>x.y.z.255</varname> is reserved as the
    <emphasis>Subnet Broadcast Address</emphasis>. In Shorewall, a subnet is
    described using <ulink url="shorewall_setup_guide.htm#Subnets">Classless
    InterDomain Routing (CIDR) notation</ulink> with consists of the subnet
    address followed by <varname>/24</varname>. The <quote>24</quote> refers

    <title>IP Masquerading (SNAT)</title>

    <para>The addresses reserved by RFC 1918 are sometimes referred to as
    <firstterm>non-routable</firstterm> because the Internet backbone routers
    don't forward packets which have an RFC-1918 destination address. When one
    of your local systems (let's assume computer 1 in the <link
    linkend="Diagram">above diagram</link>) sends a connection request to an
    Internet host, the firewall must perform <emphasis>Network Address
    Translation</emphasis> (<acronym>NAT</acronym>). The firewall rewrites the
    source address in the packet to be the address of the firewall's external
    interface; in other words, the firewall makes it appear to the destination
    Internet host as if the firewall itself is initiating the connection. This
    is necessary so that the destination host will be able to route return
    packets back to the firewall (remember that packets whose destination
    address is reserved by RFC 1918 can't be routed across the Internet so the
    remote host can't address its response to computer 1). When the firewall
    receives a return packet, it rewrites the destination address back to
    <systemitem class="ipaddress">10.10.10.1</systemitem> and forwards the
    packet on to computer 1.</para>

    <para>On Linux systems, the above process is often referred to as
    <emphasis>IP Masquerading</emphasis> but you will also see the term
    <emphasis>Source Network Address Translation</emphasis>
    (<acronym>SNAT</acronym>) used. Shorewall follows the convention used with
    Netfilter: <itemizedlist>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is important that these commands work properly because when you

    <para>One of your goals may be to run one or more servers on your local
    computers. Because these computers have RFC-1918 addresses, it is not
    possible for clients on the Internet to connect directly to them. It is
    rather necessary for those clients to address their connection requests to
    the firewall who rewrites the destination address to the address of your
    server and forwards the packet to that server. When your server responds,
    the firewall automatically performs <acronym><link

    response.</para>

    <para>The above process is called <emphasis>Port Forwarding</emphasis> or

    <para>Normally, when you connect to your ISP, as part of getting an IP

    (<acronym>DNS</acronym>) resolver will be automatically configured (e.g.,
    the <filename
    class="directory">/etc/</filename><filename>resolv.conf</filename> file
    will be written). Alternatively, your ISP may have given you the
    <acronym>IP</acronym> address of a pair of <acronym>DNS</acronym> name
    servers for you to manually configure as your primary and secondary name
    servers. Regardless of how <acronym>DNS</acronym> gets configured on your
    firewall, it is your responsibility to configure the resolver in your
    internal systems. You can take one of two approaches: <itemizedlist
        spacing="compact">
        <listitem>
          <para>You can configure your internal systems to use your ISP's name

          those addresses are available on their web site, you can configure
          your internal systems to use those addresses. If that information
          isn't available, look in /etc/resolv.conf on your firewall system --
          the name servers are given in "nameserver" records in that

        <listitem>

    <para>You don't have to use defined macros when coding a rule in
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename>; Shorewall will start slightly
    faster if you code your rules directly rather than using macros. The the
    rule shown above could also have been coded as follows:<programlisting>#ACTION    SOURCE    DEST               PROTO     DEST PORT(S)
ACCEPT     $FW       net                udp       53
ACCEPT     $FW       net                tcp       53</programlisting></para>

    <para>In cases where Shorewall doesn't include a defined macro to meet
    your needs, you can either define the macro yourself or you can simply
    code the appropriate rules directly.</para>

    <para>The sample also includes: <programlisting>#ACTION      SOURCE    DEST               PROTO     DEST PORT(S)
SSH(ACCEPT)  loc       $FW  </programlisting>That rule allows you to run an
    <acronym>SSH</acronym> server on your firewall and connect to that server
    from your local systems.</para>

    <para>If you wish to enable other connections from your firewall to other
    systems, the general format using a macro is: <programlisting>#ACTION         SOURCE    DEST               PROTO      DEST PORT(S)
&lt;macro&gt;(ACCEPT) $FW       <emphasis>&lt;destination zone&gt;</emphasis></programlisting>The
    general format when not using defined macros is:<programlisting>#ACTION    SOURCE    DEST               PROTO      DEST PORT(S)
ACCEPT     $FW       <emphasis>&lt;destination zone&gt; &lt;protocol&gt; &lt;port&gt;</emphasis></programlisting><example

        address of all of the firewall's interfaces from the local network.
        The only conclusion you can draw from such pinging success is that the
        link between the local system and the firewall works and that you
        probably have the local system's default gateway set correctly.</para>

        DNAT through Shorewall without changing the default gateway of the
        system receiving the forwarded requests. Requests come in through the

    <title>Disabling your existing Firewall</title>

    <para>Before starting Shorewall for the first time, it's a good idea to
    stop your existing firewall. On Redhat/CentOS/Fedora:</para>

    <programlisting><command>service iptables stop</command></programlisting>

    <para>If you are running SuSE, use Yast or Yast2 to stop
    SuSEFirewall.</para>

    <para>Once you have Shorewall running to your satisfaction, you should
    totally disable your existing firewall. On /Redhat/CentOS/Fedora:</para>

    <programlisting><command>chkconfig --del iptables</command></programlisting>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif" format="GIF" /></para>

    <para>The <ulink url="Install.htm">installation procedure</ulink>
    configures your system to start Shorewall at system boot but startup is
    disabled so that your system won't try to start Shorewall before
    configuration is complete. Once you have completed configuration of your
    firewall, you must edit /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf and set
    STARTUP_ENABLED=Yes.<graphic align="left"
    fileref="images/openlogo-nd-25.png" /><important>
        <para>Users of the .deb package must edit <filename
        class="directory">/etc/default/</filename><filename>shorewall</filename>
        and set <varname>startup=1</varname>.</para>
      </important> While you are editing <filename>shorewall.conf</filename>,
    it is a good idea to check the value of the SUBSYSLOCK option. You can
    find a description of this option by typing 'man shorewall.conf' at a
    shell prompt and searching for SUBSYSLOCK.</para>

    <para>The firewall is started using the <quote><command>shorewall
    start</command></quote> command and stopped using
    <quote><command>shorewall stop</command></quote>. When the firewall is
    stopped, routing is enabled on those hosts that have an entry in <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-routestopped.html">routestopped</ulink></filename>.
    A running firewall may be restarted using the <quote><command>shorewall
    restart</command></quote> command. If you want to totally remove any trace
    of Shorewall from your Netfilter configuration, use
    <quote><command>shorewall clear</command></quote>.</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif" format="GIF" /></para>

    <para>The two-interface sample assumes that you want to enable routing
    to/from <filename class="devicefile">eth1</filename> (the local network)
    when Shorewall is stopped. If your local network isn't connected to
    <filename class="devicefile">eth1</filename> or if you wish to enable
    access to/from other hosts, change <filename
    class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>routestopped</filename>
    accordingly. <warning>
        <para>If you are connected to your firewall from the Internet, do not
        issue a <quote><command>shorewall stop</command></quote> command
        unless you have added an entry for the <acronym>IP</acronym> address
        that you are connected from to <filename
        class="directory">/etc/shorewall/</filename><filename>routestopped</filename>.
        Also, I don't recommend using <quote><command>shorewall

        configuration and test it using the <quote><command>shorewall
        try</command></quote> command.</para>
      </warning></para>

    <para>The firewall will start after your network interfaces have been
    brought up. This leaves a small window between the time that the network
    interfaces are working and when the firewall is controlling connections
    through those interfaces. If this is a concern, you can close that window
    by installing the <ulink url="Shorewall-init.html">Shorewall Init

  <section id="Wireless">
    <title>Adding a Wireless Segment to your Two-Interface Firewall</title>

    <para>Once you have the two-interface setup working, the next logical step
    is to add a Wireless Network. The first step involves adding an additional
    network card to your firewall, either a Wireless card or an Ethernet card
    that is connected to a Wireless Access Point.<caution>
        <para>When you add a network card, it won't necessarily be detected as
        the next highest Ethernet interface. For example, if you have two
        Ethernet cards in your system (<filename
        class="devicefile">eth0</filename> and <filename
        class="devicefile">eth1</filename>) and you add a third card that uses
        the same driver as one of the other two, that third card won't
        necessarily be detected as <filename
        class="devicefile">eth2</filename>; it could rather be detected as
        <filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename> or <filename
        class="devicefile">eth1</filename>! You can either live with that or
        you can shuffle the cards around in the slots until the new card is
        detected as <filename class="devicefile">eth2</filename>.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Update</emphasis>: Distributions are
        getting better about this. <trademark>SuSE</trademark> now associates
        a unique interface name with each MAC address. Other distributions
        have add-on packages to manage the relationship between MAC addresses
        and device names.</para>
      </caution></para>

    <para>Your new network will look similar to what is shown in the following
    figure.<graphic align="center" fileref="images/basics2.png" /></para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif" format="GIF" /></para>

    <para>The first thing to note is that the computers in your wireless
    network will be in a different subnet from those on your wired local LAN.
    In the above example, we have chosen to use the network 10.10.11.0/24.
    Computers 3 and 4 would be configured with a default gateway IP address of
    10.10.11.254.</para>

    <para>Second, we have chosen to include the wireless network as part of
    the local zone. Since Shorewall allows intra-zone traffic by default,
    traffic may flow freely between the local wired network and the wireless
    network.</para>

    <para><inlinegraphic fileref="images/BD21298_.gif" format="GIF" /></para>

    <para>There are only two changes that need to be made to the Shorewall
    configuration:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>An entry needs to be added to
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> for the wireless
        network interface. If the wireless interface is <filename
        class="devicefile">wlan0</filename>, the entry might look like:</para>

        <programlisting>#ZONE     INTERFACE       BROADCAST          OPTIONS
loc       wlan0           detect             maclist</programlisting>

        <para>As shown in the above entry, I recommend using the <ulink
        url="MAC_Validation.html">maclist option</ulink> for the wireless
        segment. By adding entries for computers 3 and 4 in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/maclist</filename>, you help ensure that your
        neighbors aren't getting a free ride on your Internet connection.
        Start by omitting that option; when you have everything working, then
        add the option and configure your
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/maclist</filename> file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You need to add an entry to the
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> file to masquerade traffic
        from the wireless network to the Internet. If your Internet interface
        is <filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename> and your wireless
        interface is <filename class="devicefile">wlan0</filename>, the entry
        would be:</para>

        <programlisting>#INTERFACE           SUBNET             ADDRESS
eth0                 wlan0</programlisting>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>One other thing to note. To get <trademark>Microsoft</trademark>
    networking working between the wireless and wired networks, you will need
    either a WINS server or a PDC. I personally use Samba configured as a WINS
    server running on my firewall. Running a WINS server on your firewall
    requires the rules listed in the <ulink url="samba.htm">Shorewall/Samba
    documentation</ulink>.</para>
