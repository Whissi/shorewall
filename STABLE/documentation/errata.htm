                              <p>DNAT rules where the source zone is 'fw' ($FW) 
                              result in an error message. Installing

                              <p>&quot;shorewall refresh&quot; is not creating the proper 
                              rule for FORWARDPING=Yes. Consequently, after 
                              &quot;shorewall refresh&quot;, the firewall will not forward 
                              icmp echo-request (ping) packets. Installing

                              <h3>Version &lt;= 1.3.7a</h3>

                              <p>If &quot;norfc1918&quot; and &quot;dhcp&quot; are both specified as 
                              options on a given interface then RFC 1918 
                              checking is occurring before DHCP checking. This 
                              means that if a DHCP client broadcasts using an 
                              RFC 1918 source address, then the firewall will 
                              reject the broadcast (usually logging it). This 
                              has two problems:</p>

                              <ol>
                                <li>If the firewall is running a DHCP server, 
                                the client won't be able to obtain an IP address 
                                lease from that server.</li>
                                <li>With this order of checking, the &quot;dhcp&quot; 
                                option cannot be used as a noise-reduction 
                                measure where there are both dynamic and static 
                                clients on a LAN segment.</li>

   <p>The RedHat iptables RPM is compiled with debugging enabled but the 
   user-space debugging code was not updated to reflect recent changes in the 
   Netfilter 'mangle' table. You can correct the problem by installing
   <a href="http://www.shorewall.net/pub/shorewall/iptables-1.2.5-1.i386.rpm">
   this iptables RPM</a>. If you are already running a 1.2.5 version of 
   iptables, you will need to specify the --oldpackage option to rpm (e.g., 
   &quot;iptables -Uvh --oldpackage iptables-1.2.5-1.i386.rpm&quot;).</p>

                              <p>The iptables 1.2.7 release of iptables has made 
                              an incompatible change to the syntax used to 
                              specify multiport match rules; as a consequence, 
                              if you install iptables 1.2.7 you must be running 
                              Shorewall 1.3.7a or later or:</p>

                              <ul>

                                <li>if you are running Shorewall 1.3.6 you may
