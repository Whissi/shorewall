  <warning>
    <para>Reading just Shorewall documentation is probably not going to give
    you enough background to use this material. Shorewall may make iptables
    easy but the Shorewall team doesn't have the resources to be able to
    spoon-feed Linux policy routing to you (please remember that the user's
    manual for a tractor doesn't teach you to grow corn either). You will
    likely need to refer to the following additional information:</para>

        <command>shorewall restart</command>). Ideally, restarting the packet
        filter should have no effect on routing.</para>

        <para>For most routing applications, <ulink

      <para>Let's assume that a firewall is connected via two separate
      Ethernet interfaces to two different ISPs.<footnote>
          <para>While we describe a setup using different ISPs in this
          article, the facility also works with two uplinks from the same
          ISP.</para>
        </footnote> as in the following diagram.</para>

      <graphic align="center" fileref="images/TwoISPs.png" valign="middle" />

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>eth0 connects to ISP1. The IP address of eth0 is
          206.124.146.176 and the ISP's gateway router has IP address
          206.124.146.254.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eth1 connects to ISP 2. The IP address of eth1 is
          130.252.99.27 and the ISP's gateway router has IP address
          130.252.99.254.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>eth2 connects to the local LAN. Its IP configuration is not
          relevant to this discussion.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Each of these <firstterm>providers</firstterm> is described in an
      entry in the file <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>.</para>

      <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> can
      specify that outgoing connections are to be load-balanced between the
      two ISPs. Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> and
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/rtrules</filename> can be used to direct
      particular outgoing connections to one ISP or the other. Use of
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> is not required for
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename> to work, but in most
      cases, you must select a unique MARK value for each provider so
      Shorewall can set up the correct marking rules for you.</para>

      <para>When you use the <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/providers</filename>, connections from the
      Internet are automatically routed back out of the correct interface and
      through the correct ISP gateway. This works whether the connection is
      handled by the firewall itself or if it is routed or port-forwarded to a
      system behind the firewall.</para>

      <para>Shorewall will set up the routing and will update the
      <filename>/etc/iproute2/rt_tables</filename> to include the table names
      and numbers of the tables that it adds.</para>

      <caution>
        <para>This feature uses <ulink url="traffic_shaping.htm">packet
        marking</ulink> to control the routing. As a consequence, there are
        some restrictions concerning entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Packet marking for traffic control purposes may not be done
            in the PREROUTING table for connections involving providers with

          <listitem>
            <para>You may not use the SAVE or RESTORE options unless you also
            set HIGH_ROUTE_MARKS=Yes (PROVIDER_OFFSET &gt; 0 with Shorewall
            4.4.26 and later) in

          <listitem>
            <para>You may not use connection marking unless you also set

                  outgoing connections remain stay anchored to a single
                  provider and don't try to switch providers when route cache
                  entries expire.</para>

                  means that routes to often-used sites will always be over

                  <para>By default, each provider is given the same weight (1)

                  desired weight (e.g., balance=2). The weights reflect the
                  relative bandwidth of the providers connections and should
                  be small numbers since the kernel actually creates

      <title>What an entry in the Providers File Does</title>

      <para>Adding another entry in the providers file simply creates an
      alternate routing table for you (see the<ulink
      url="http://www.lartc.org"> LARTC Howto</ulink>). The table will usually
      contain two routes:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A host route to the specified GATEWAY through the specified
          INTERFACE.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A default route through the GATEWAY.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Note that the first route is omitted if "-" is specified as the
      GATEWAY; in that case, the default route does not specify a gateway
      (point-to-point link).</para>

      <para>If the DUPLICATE column is non-empty, then routes from the table
      named in that column are copied into the new table. By default, all
      routes (except default routes) are copied. The set of routes copied can
      be restricted using the COPY column which lists the interfaces whose
      routes you want copied. You will generally want to include all local
      interfaces in this list. You should exclude the loopback interface (lo)
      and any interfaces that do not have an IP configuration. You should also
      omit interfaces like <emphasis role="bold">tun</emphasis> interfaces
      that are created dynamically. Traffic to networks handled by those
      interfaces should be routed through the main table using entries in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/rtrules</filename> (see Example 2 <link
      linkend="Examples">below</link>) or by using <link
      linkend="USE_DEFAULT_RT">USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes</link>.</para>

      <para>In addition:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Unless <emphasis role="bold">loose</emphasis> is specified, an
          ip rule is generated for each IP address on the INTERFACE that
          routes traffic from that address through the associated routing
          table.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you specify <emphasis role="bold">track</emphasis>, then
          connections which have had at least one packet arrive on the
          interface listed in the INTERFACE column have their connection mark
          set to the value in the MARK column. In the PREROUTING chain,
          packets with a connection mark have their packet mark set to the
          value of the associated connection mark; packets marked in this way
          bypass any prerouting rules that you create in
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename>. This ensures that
          packets associated with connections from outside are always routed
          out of the correct interface.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you specify <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis>, then
          Shorewall will replace the 'default' route with weight 100 in the
          'main' routing table with a load-balancing route among those
          gateways where <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> was
          specified. So if you configure default routes, be sure that their
          weight is less than 100 or the route added by Shorewall will not be
          used.</para>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>That's <emphasis role="bold">all</emphasis> that these entries do.

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Routing determines where packets are to be sent.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Once routing determines where the packet is to go, the
          firewall (Shorewall) determines if the packet is allowed to go there

        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The bottom line is that if you want traffic to go out through a
      particular provider then you <emphasis>must </emphasis>mark that traffic
      with the provider's MARK value in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> and you must do that marking

    <section>
      <title>/etc/shorewall/masq and Multi-ISP</title>

      <para>If you masquerade a local network, you will need to add masquerade
      rules for both external interfaces. Referring to the diagram above, if
      each of the interfaces has only a single IP address and you have no
      systems with public IP addresses behind your firewall, then I suggest
      the following simple entries:</para>

      <programlisting>#INTERFACE       SOURCE            ADDRESS
eth0             0.0.0.0/0         206.124.146.176
eth1             0.0.0.0/0         130.252.99.27</programlisting>

      <para>If you have a public subnet (for example 206.124.146.176/30)
      behind your firewall, then use exclusion:</para>

      <programlisting>#INTERFACE       SOURCE               ADDRESS
eth0             !206.124.146.176/29  206.124.146.176
eth1             0.0.0.0/0            130.252.99.27</programlisting>

      <para>Note that exclusion is only used on the interface corresponding to
      internal subnetwork.</para>

      <para>If you have multiple IP addresses on one of your interfaces, you
      can use a similar technique -- simplY exclude the smallest network that
      contains all of those addresses from being masqueraded.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> have no
        effect on which ISP a particular connection will be sent through. That
        is rather the purpose of entries in
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> and
        <filename>/etc/shorewall/rtrules</filename>.</para>
      </warning>
    </section>

    <section id="Martians">
      <title>Martians</title>

      <para>One problem that often arises with Multi-ISP configuration is
      'Martians'. If your Internet interfaces are configured with the
      <emphasis role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/interfaces</filename> (remember that if you set
      that option, you should also select <emphasis
      role="bold">logmartians</emphasis>), then things may not work correctly
      and you will see messages like this:</para>

      <programlisting>Feb  9 17:23:45 gw.ilinx kernel: martian source 206.124.146.176 from 64.86.88.116, on dev eth1 
Feb  9 17:23:45 gw.ilinx kernel: ll header: 00:a0:24:2a:1f:72:00:13:5f:07:97:05:08:00</programlisting>

      <para>The above message is somewhat awkwardly phrased. The source IP in
      this incoming packet was 64.86.88.116 and the destination IP address was
      206.124.146.176. Another gotcha is that the incoming packet has already
      had the destination IP address changed for DNAT or because the original
      outgoing connection was altered by an entry in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> (SNAT or Masquerade). So the
      destination IP address (206.124.146.176) may not have been the
      destination IP address in the packet as it was initially
      received.</para>

      <para>There a couple of common causes for these problems:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You have connected both of your external interfaces to the
          same hub/switch. Connecting multiple firewall interfaces to a common
          hub or switch is always a bad idea that will result in
          hard-to-diagnose problems.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You are specifying both the <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="bold">balance</emphasis> options on your provider(s). This can
          cause individual connections to ping-pong back and forth between the
          interfaces which is almost guaranteed to cause problems.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You are redirecting traffic from the firewall system out of
          one interface or the other using packet marking in your
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/tcrules</filename> file. A better approach
          is to configure the application to use the appropriate local IP
          address (the IP address of the interface that you want the
          application to use). See <link linkend="Local">below</link>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If all else fails, remove the <emphasis
      role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> option from your external interfaces.
      If you do this, you may wish to add rules to log and drop packets from
      the Internet that have source addresses in your local networks. For
      example, if the local LAN in the above diagram is 192.168.1.0/24, then
      you would add this rule:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION          SOURCE                     DEST
DROP:info        net:192.168.1.0/24         all</programlisting>

      <para>Be sure the above rule is added before any other rules with
      <emphasis>net</emphasis> in the SOURCE column.</para>

      traffic originating from the firewall.</para>

      <para>Experience has shown that in some cases, problems occur with
      applications running on the firewall itself. This is especially true
      when you have specified <emphasis role="bold">routefilter</emphasis> on
      your external interfaces in /etc/shorewall/interfaces (see <link
      linkend="Martians">above</link>). When this happens, it is suggested
      that you have the application use specific local IP addresses rather
      than 0.</para>

      <para>Note that some traffic originating on the firewall doesn't have a

          <para>Prohibit routes</para>

          <para>Similar to "unreachable" routes above, when a request for a
          routing decision returns a destination with a prohibit route type,
          the kernel generates an ICMP prohibited to return to the source
          address.</para>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting>ip route add prohibit 10.22.0.12

          <para>Blackhole routes</para>

          <para>The difference between this type of routing and the previous

        <title>Null Routing Implementation in Shorewall</title>

        <para>As of Shorewall 4.5.14, the only type of null routing
        implemented in Shorewall is "blackhole" routing. This can be specified
        in two different ways as described below.</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Null Routing with NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918 shorewall.conf
            configuration option.</para>

            <para>When NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918 is set to Yes, it causes Shorewall
            to null-route the IPv4 address ranges reserved by RFC1918 (private
            networks).</para>

            <para>When combined with route filtering (ROUTE_FILTER=Yes or
            routefilter in <ulink
            url="manpages/shorewall-interfaces.html">shorewall-interfaces</ulink>(5)),
            this option ensures that packets with an RFC1918 source address
            are only accepted from interfaces having known routes to networks
            using such addresses.</para>

            <para>When this option is used, the blackhole routes for all
            RFC1918 subnets are defined for the "main" routing table only.
            These, however, can be copied over to different routing tables or
            further customised and fine-tuned to suit individual needs by
            using the "routes" file (see below).</para>

            <para>For example, by specifying NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918=Yes in
            shorewall.conf, Shorewall generates 3 different route statements
            to be executed at Shorewall startup:</para>

            <programlisting>ip route replace blackhole 10.0.0.0/8
ip route replace blackhole 172.16.0.0/12
ip replace blackhole 192.168.0.0/16
</programlisting>

            <important>
              <para>When NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918=Yes is used, Shorewall creates a
              shell script file in ${VARDIR}/undo_rfc1918_routing to undo the
              null routing, if needed (see below as to some instances when
              this may be necessary).</para>
            </important>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Null Routing Using Shorewall "routes" (added in Shorewall
            4.5.14)</para>

            <para>By definition, entries in this file are used to define
            routes to be added to provider routing tables, including the
            default routing table (main).</para>

            <para>This option allows for a better control over what is defined
            as a null route in Shorewall and also allows for custom-defined
            subnets (in addition to RFC1918 type networks) to be added.
            Blackhole routes defined in this way need to include the word
            "blackhole" in the GATEWAY column and the DEVICE column must also
            be ommitted (see example below).</para>

            <para>Example of use
            (<filename>/etc/shorewall/routes</filename>):</para>

dmz             192.168.14.0/26 blackhole
</programlisting>

            <para>The above generates the following 3 statements for execution
            upon Shorewall startup:</para>

            <programlisting>ip route add blackhole 10.0.0.0/8 table main
ip route add blackhole 82.32.0.0/12 table dmz
ip route add blackhole 192.168.14.0/26 table dmz</programlisting>

            <important>
              <para>When blackhole routes are added to a
              <replaceable>provider</replaceable> (including 'main'),
              Shorewall creates a shell script file in
              ${VARDIR}/undo_<replaceable>provider</replaceable>_routing to
              undo the routing, if needed (see below as to some instances when
              this may be necessary).</para>

          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.5.15, Shorewall also supports
        "unreachable" and "prohibit" routing.</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918 option may be set to "blackhole",

            <para>Shorewall will create the three route statements using the
            specified type type. For compatibility with earlier releases,
            "Yes" is equivalent to "blackhole".</para>

            <para>For example, if NULL_ROUTE_RFC1918=prohibit, then the
            following three route statements will be executed at Shorewall
            startup:</para>

            <programlisting>ip route replace prohibit 10.0.0.0/8
ip route replace prohibit 172.16.0.0/12

        <title>Important Points To Remember When Using Null Routing in
        Shorewall</title>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>In order to create "pinhole" in a particular blackhole
            route, at least one route needs to be defined in addition to the
            null route.</para>

            <para>Lets take the following example: We need to null-route all
            addresses from the 10.0.0.0/8 range, <emphasis
            role="bold">except</emphasis> 10.1.0.0/24. In such a case we need
            to define two routes in our "routes" file (assuming the default
            "main" routing table is used and also assuming that 10.1.0.0/24 is
            routed via the default gateway on eth0 and we need to use
            'blackhole' type null routing).</para>

            <para><filename>/etc/shorewall/routes</filename>:</para>

            <programlisting>#PROVIDER       DEST            GATEWAY         DEVICE
main            10.0.0.0/8      blackhole
main            10.1.0.0/24     -               eth0</programlisting>

            <para>The above will generate 2 statements for execution when
            Shorewall starts:</para>

            <programlisting>ip route replace blackhole 10.0.0.0/8 table main
ip route replace 10.1.0.0/24 table main
</programlisting>

            <para>The order in which the two routes above are defined in
            "routes" is not important, simply because, by definition, routes
            with lower mask value are always traversed first. In that way,
            packets originating from or destined to 10.1.0.0/24 will always be
            processed before the 10.0.0.0/8 blackhole route.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Null routes, by their definition, are not attached to any
            network device. What this means in reality is that when the status
            of a particular device changes (either going up or down), that has
            absolutely <emphasis role="bold">no</emphasis> effect on the null
            routes defined (as already indicated, these are "static" and can
            only be removed by executing "ip route del" or by executing the
            relevant ${VARDIR}/undo_*_routing shell script).</para>

            <important>
              <para>The ${VARDIR}/undo_*_routing scripts generated by
              Shorewall 4.5.14 and earlier cannot be executed directly from
              the shell without first sourcing
              ${SHAREDIR}/shorewall/functions. Example:</para>

              <programlisting>. /usr/share/shorewall/functions
. /var/lib/shorewall/undo_x_routing</programlisting>
            </important>

            <para>This sometimes may lead to undesirable side effect: when a
            network interface goes down (even temporarily), then <emphasis
            role="bold">all</emphasis> routes defined or attached to that
            interface are simply deleted from the routing table by the kernel,
            while the blackhole routes are untouched.</para>

            <para>Lets take our example above: when eth0 goes down, then the
            route we defined in "routes" for our private subnet (10.1.0.0/24)
            will be deleted from the routing table. As soon as eth0 goes back
            up again, unless the route for our private 10.1.0.0/24 subnet is
            defined again, all packets originating from or destined to
            10.1.0.0/24 will simply be dropped by the kernel!</para>

            <para>An indication of this type of behaviour is getting endless
            "martian" packets reported in the system log, like so:</para>

            <programlisting>IPv4: martian source 10.1.0.7 from 10.1.0.1, on dev eth0</programlisting>

            <para>There are currently two possible solutions to this
            particular problem:</para>

            <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
              <listitem>
                <para>Add all network-interface dependent routes (the ones
                which are deleted when that interface goes down) to your
                distribution's network configuration system. On Redhat and
                derivatives, that would be
                <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-X</filename>
                (where "X" is the name of the interface in question). On
                Debian and derivatives, it is
                <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename>.</para>

                <para>That way, when the network device goes back up again,
                the Linux OS will add these routes "automatically". Using our
                example above - to add a route to 10.1.0.0/24 using the
                default gateway on eth0 and also using the main routing table,
                the following needs to be added to
                <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0</filename>
                (Redhat and derivatives):</para>

                <programlisting>10.1.0.0/24 dev eth0 table main
</programlisting>

                <para>On Debian and derivatives (in the eth0 stanza of
                <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename>):</para>

                <programlisting>iface eth0 ...
       ... 
       post-up ip route add 10.1.0.0/24 dev eth0 table main</programlisting>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>A more elegant solution is, in addition to the
                "standard" shorewall package (shorewall-lite, shorewall, etc),
                to add <ulink url="Shorewall-init.html">shorewall-init</ulink>
                to take care of this automatically.</para>

                <para>With this approach, when the network interface is
                brought back up, the OS passes control to /sbin/ifup-local,
                which forms part of the shorewall-init package, and that
                script, in turn, executes the appropriate command to reload
                the network device settings in the already-compiled
                ${VARDIR}/firewall file.</para>

                <para>When shorewall-init is used, all configuration settings
                (routes, interface options etc) are kept in one place and do
                not have to be defined separately (via
                /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-X for example), which
                eases maintenance efforts quite considerably.</para>

      <title>Looking at the routing tables</title>

      <para>To look at the various routing tables, you must use the <emphasis

      configuration (including rules), the command is <command>shorewall show

      <para>One of the drawbacks of the Multi-ISP support as described in the

      <para>Note that the main routing table is consulted prior to the marks
      for his two provlders. When clients in the large /19 network connected
      to his /27 (through ISP1), the responses were routed out of the ISP2
      interface because the main routing table included a route to the

      <para>The solution was to add an additional entry to rtrules:</para>

      <title>Two Providers Sharing an Interface</title>

      <para>Shared interface support has the following characteristics:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>Only Ethernet (or Ethernet-like) interfaces can be used. For
          inbound traffic, the MAC addresses of the gateway routers are used
          to determine which provider a packet was received through. Note that
          only routed traffic can be categorized using this technique.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must specify the address on the interface that corresponds
          to a particular provider in the INTERFACE column by following the
          interface name with a colon (":") and the address.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Entries in <filename>/etc/shorewall/masq</filename> must be
          qualified by the provider name (or number).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>This feature requires Realm Match support in your kernel and
          iptables.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must add rtrules entries for networks that are accessed
          through a particular provider.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you have additional IP addresses through either provider,
          you must add <filename>rtrules</filename> to direct traffic FROM
          each of those addresses through the appropriate provider.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must manually add MARK rules for traffic known to come
          from each provider.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You must specify a gateway IP address in the GATEWAY column
          of<filename> /etc/shorewall/providers</filename>; <emphasis
          role="bold">detect</emphasis> is not permitted.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Taken together, b. and h. effectively preclude using this
      technique with dynamic IP addresses.</para>

      <para>Example:</para>

      <para>This is our home network circa fall 2008. We have two Internet
      providers:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Comcast -- Cable modem with one dynamic IP address.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Avvanta -- ADSL with 5 static IP addresses.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Because the old <trademark>Compaq</trademark>
      <trademark>Presario</trademark> that I use for a firewall only has three
      PCI slots and no onboard Ethernet, it doesn't have enough Ethernet
      controllers to support both providers. So I use a Linksys WRT300n pre-N
      router as a gateway to Comcast. Note that because the Comcast IP address
      is dynamic, I could not share a single firewall interface between the
      two providers directly.</para>

      <para>On my personal laptop (ursa), I have 9 virtual machines running
      various Linux distributions. <emphasis>It is the Shorewall configuration
      on ursa that I will describe here</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Below is a diagram of our network:<graphic align="center"
      fileref="images/Network2008a.png" /></para>

      <para>The local wired network in my office is connected to both gateways
      and uses the private (RFC 1918) network 172.20.1.0/24. The Comcast
      gateway has local IP address 172.20.1.1 while the Avvanta gateway has
      local IP address 172.20.1.254. Ursa's eth0 interface has a single IP
      address (172.20.1.130).</para>

      <para>This configuration uses USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes in
      <filename>shorewall.conf </filename>(see <link
      linkend="USE_DEFAULT_RT">above</link>).</para>

      <para>Here is the <filename>providers</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>#NAME          NUMBER   MARK DUPLICATE INTERFACE            GATEWAY      OPTIONS                            COPY

      <para>Several things to note:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>172.20.1.130 is specified as the <filename
          class="devicefile">eth0</filename> IP address for both
          providers.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Both wired providers have the <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> option. This prevents Shorewall from
          automatically generating routing rules based on the source IP
          address.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Only <emphasis role="bold">comcast</emphasis> has the
          <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> option. With
          USE_DEFAULT_RT=yes, that means that <emphasis
          role="bold">comcast</emphasis> will be the default provider. While
          <emphasis role="bold">balance</emphasis> is the default, with
          USE_DEFAULT_RT=Yes, it must be specified explicitly when <emphasis
          role="bold">loose</emphasis> is also specified.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>I always disable the <emphasis role="bold">wireless</emphasis>
          interface when the laptop is connected to the wired network.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>I use a different Shorewall configuration when I take the
          laptop on the road.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Here is the rtrules file:<programlisting>#SOURCE                 DEST                    PROVIDER        PRIORITY

      <para>Those rules direct traffic to the five static Avvanta IP addresses
      (only two are currently used) through the <emphasis
      role="bold">avvanta</emphasis> provider.</para>

      <para>Here is the tcrules file (MARK_IN_FORWARD_CHAIN=No in

    <title>A Complete Working Example</title>

    <para>This section describes the network at shorewall.net in late 2012.
    The configuration is as follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

    <para>The network is pictured in the following diagram:</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/Network2012a.png" />

    <section>
      <title>IPv4 Configuration</title>

      <para>The Business Gateway manages a gigabit local network with address
      10.0.1.1/24. So The firewall is given address 10.0.1.11/24 and the
      gateway is configured to route the public IP block via that address. The
      gateway's firewall is only enabled for the 10.0.1.0/24 network.</para>

      <para>Because the business network is faster and more reliable, the
      configuration favors sending local network traffic via that uplink
      rather than the consumer line.</para>

      <title>IPv6 Configuration</title>

      <para>The IPv6 configuration has two separate sub-nets, both services
      through 6in4 tunnels from <ulink
      url="http://tunnelbroker.he.net">Hurricane Electric</ulink>. They are
      both configured through the Business IPv4 uplink. I originally had the
      sit2 tunnel configured through the consumer uplink but Comcast (Xfinity)
      decided to start blocking HE IPv6 tunnels on their consumer network,
      preferring their own 6to4 IPv6 solution.</para>

      <para>One HE tunnel handles the servers and one tunnel handles the local
      network.</para>
