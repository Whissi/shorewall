#
# Shorewall version 4 - Default Config Path
#
# /usr/share/shorewall/configpath
#
# Note to maintainers.
#
#	The CONFDIR variable is normally set to /etc/shorewall but when
#	the command is "compile -e" then CONFDIR is set to
#	/usr/share/shorewall/configfiles/. This prevents 'compile -e'
#	from trying to use configuration information from /etc/shorewall.
