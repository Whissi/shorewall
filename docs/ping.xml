    <para>In Shorewall , ICMP echo-request's are treated just like any other
    connection request.</para>

    <para>In order to accept ping requests from zone z1 to zone z2 where the
    policy for z1 to z2 is not ACCEPT, you need a rule in
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> of the form:</para>

    <programlisting>#ACTION      SOURCE    DEST     PROTO    DEST PORT(S)
Ping/ACCEPT    z1        z2</programlisting>

    <example id="Example1">
      <title>Ping from local zone to firewall</title>

      <para>To permit ping from the local zone to the firewall:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION      SOURCE    DEST     PROTO    DEST PORT(S)
Ping/ACCEPT   loc      $FW</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>If you would like to accept <quote>ping</quote> by default even when
    the relevant policy is DROP or REJECT, copy
    <filename>/usr/share/shorewall/action.Drop</filename> or
    <filename>/usr/share shorewall/action.Reject</filename> respectively to
    <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> and simply add this
    line to the copy:</para>

    <programlisting>Ping/ACCEPT</programlisting>

    <para>With that rule in place, if you want to ignore <quote>ping</quote>
    from z1 to z2 then you need a rule of the form:</para>

    <programlisting>#ACTION      SOURCE    DEST     PROTO    DEST PORT(S)
Ping/DROP     z1        z2</programlisting>

    <example id="Example2">
      <title>Silently drop pings from the Internet</title>

      <para>To drop ping from the internet, you would need this rule in
      <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename>:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION    SOURCE    DEST     PROTO    DEST PORT(S)
Ping/DROP  net       $FW</programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>Note that the above rule may be used without changing the action
    files to prevent your log from being flooded by messages generated from
    remote pinging.</para>
