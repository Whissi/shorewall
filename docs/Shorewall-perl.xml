  <section id="What">
    <title>Shorewall-perl - What is it?</title>

    <para>Shorewall-perl was released as a companion product to Shorewall in
    Shorewall 4.0.0.</para>

    <para>Shorewall-perl contained a re-implementation of the Shorewall
    compiler written in Perl. The advantages of using Shorewall-perl over
    Shorewall-shell (the shell-based compiler included in earlier Shorewall
    3.x releases) were:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The Shorewall-perl compiler was much faster.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The script generated by the compiler used
        <command>iptables-restore</command> to instantiate the Netfilter
        configuration. So it ran much faster than the script generated by the
        Shorewall-shell compiler and did not stop new connections during
        <command>shorewall restart</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Shorewall-perl compiler did more thorough checking of the
        configuration than the Shorewall-shell compiler did.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The error messages produced by the compiler were better, more
        consistent and always included the file name and line number where the
        error was detected.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Going forward, the Shorewall-perl compiler got all enhancements;
        the Shorewall-shell compilerl only got those enhancements that were
        easy to retrofit.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.3.5, Shorewall-perl is an integral part
    of Shorewall and support for Shorewall-shell has been discontinued.</para>

  <section id="DownSide">
    <title>Shorewall-perl - The down side</title>

    <para>While there are significant advantages to using Shorewall-perl,
    there are also disadvantages.</para>

      <title>Incompatibilities</title>

      <para>There are a number of incompatibilities between the Shorewall-perl
      compiler and the earlier one.</para>

          kernel and iptables.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>BRIDGING=Yes is not supported. The kernel code necessary to
          support this option was removed in Linux kernel 2.6.20. <ulink

          <para>The BROADCAST column in the interfaces file is essentially
          unused if your kernel/iptables has Address Type Match support. If
          that support is present and you enter anything in this column but
          '-' or 'detect', you will receive a warning.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The 'refresh' command is now similar to restart with the
          exceptions that:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The command fails if Shorewall is not running.</para>

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The refresh command does not alter the Netfilter
              configuration except for the static blacklist (it also refreshes
              the mangle table, beginning with Shorewall 4.2.0).</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>

        <listitem id="Extensions">
          <para>With the shell-based compiler, extension scripts were copied
          into the compiled script and executed at run-time. In many cases,
          this approach doesn't work with Shorewall Perl because (almost) the
          entire rule set is built by the compiler. As a result,
          Shorewall-perl runs some extension scripts at compile-time rather
          than at run-time. Because the compiler is written in Perl, your
          extension scripts from earlier versions will no longer work.</para>

          <para>The following table summarizes when the various extension
          scripts are run:</para>

          <para>Compile-time extension scripts are executed using the Perl
          'eval `cat &lt;file&gt;`' mechanism. Be sure that each script
          returns a 'true' value; otherwise, the Shorewall-perl compiler will
          assume that the script failed and will abort the compilation.</para>

          <para>When a script is invoked, the <emphasis
          role="bold">$chainref</emphasis> scalar variable will usually hold a
          reference to a chain table entry.</para>

          <simplelist>
            <member><emphasis role="bold">$chainref-&gt;{name}</emphasis>
            contains the name of the chain</member>

            <member><emphasis role="bold">$chainref-&gt;{table}</emphasis>
            holds the table name</member>
          </simplelist>

          <para>To add a rule to the chain:</para>

            <member>add_rule $chainref,
            <replaceable>the-rule</replaceable></member>

            <replaceable>the-rule</replaceable></member>
          </simplelist>

          <para>The log_rule_limit function works like it does in the shell
          compiler with three exceptions:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>You pass the chain reference rather than the name of the

            <listitem>
              <para>The commands are 'add' and 'insert' rather than '-A' and
              '-I'.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>There is only a single "pass as-is to iptables" argument
              (so you must quote that part)</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Example:</para>

          <programlisting>    log_rule_limit
              'info' , 
              $chainref , 
              $chainref-&gt;{name},
              'DROP' , 
              '',    #Limit
              '' ,   #Log tag
              'add'
              '-p tcp ';         </programlisting>

          <para>Here is an example of an actual initdone script used with
          Shorewall 3.4:<programlisting>run_iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -p esp -j MARK --set-mark 0x50
run_iptables -t filter -I INPUT -p udp --dport 1701 -m mark --mark 0x50 -j ACCEPT
run_iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT -p udp --sport 1701 -j ACCEPT
</programlisting></para>

          <para>Here is the corresponding script used with
          Shorewall-perl:<programlisting>use Shorewall::Chains;

insert_rule $mangle_table-&gt;{PREROUTING}, 1, "-p esp -j MARK --set-mark 0x50";
insert_rule $filter_table-&gt;{INPUT},      1, "-p udp --dport 1701 -m mark --mark 0x50 -j ACCEPT";
insert_rule $filter_table-&gt;{OUTPUT},     1, "-p udp --sport 1701 -j ACCEPT";

1;</programlisting></para>

          <para>The initdone script is unique because the $chainref variable
          is not set before the script is called. The above script illustrates
          how the $mangle_table, $filter_table, and $nat_table references can
          be used to add or insert rules in arbitrary chains.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The <filename>/etc/shorewall/tos</filename> file now has
          zone-independent SOURCE and DEST columns as do all other files
          except the rules and policy files.</para>

          <para>The SOURCE column may be one of the following:</para>

          <simplelist>
            <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]</member>

            <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>interface</replaceable>&gt;[:&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]]</member>

            <member><command>$FW</command>[:&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]]</member>
          </simplelist>

          <para>The DEST column may be one of the following:</para>

          <simplelist>
            <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]</member>

            <member>[<command>all</command>:]&lt;<replaceable>interface</replaceable>&gt;[:&lt;<replaceable>address</replaceable>&gt;[,...]]</member>
          </simplelist>

          <para>This is a permanent change. The old zone-based rules have
          never worked right and this is a good time to replace them. I've
          tried to make the new syntax cover the most common cases without
          requiring change to existing files. In particular, it will handle
          the tos file released with Shorewall 1.4 and earlier.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem id="SAVE_IPSETS">
          <para>Shorewall-perl insists that ipset names begin with a letter
          and be composed of alphanumeric characters and underscores (_). When
          used in a Shorewall configuration file, the name must be preceded by
          a plus sign (+) as with the shell-based compiler.</para>

          <para>From Shorewall-perl 4.0.0 - Shorewall 4.4.5, Shorewall was out
          of the ipset load/reload business with the exception of ipsets used
          for dynamic zones:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para>With scripts generated by the Perl-based Compiler, the
            Netfilter rule set is never cleared. That means that there is no
            opportunity for Shorewall to load/reload your ipsets since that
            cannot be done while there are any current rules using
            ipsets.</para>

            <para>So:</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>Your ipsets must be loaded before Shorewall starts. You

                <para>The file <filename>/etc/shorewall/ipsets</filename> will
                normally be produced using the <command>ipset -S</command>

                <para>The above extension scripts will work most of the time
                but will fail in a <command>shorewall stop</command> -
                <command>shorewall start</command> sequence if you use ipsets
                in your routestopped file (see below).</para>

            </orderedlist>

            <para>As a consequence, scripts generated by the Perl-based

          </blockquote>

          <para>Beginning with Shorewall 4.4.6 (and 4.5.3), SAVE_IPSETS=Yes is

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Because the configuration files (with the exception of
          <filename>/etc/shorewall/params</filename>) are now processed by the

          forms of Shell expansion ($variable and ${variable}) are supported.
          The more exotic forms such as ${variable:=default} are not
          supported. Both variables defined in /etc/shorewall/params and

        <listitem>
          <para>USE_ACTIONS=No is not supported. That option is intended to
          minimize Shorewall's footprint in embedded applications. As a
          consequence, Default Macros are not supported by
          Shorewall-perl.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>DELAYBLACKLISTLOAD=Yes is not supported. The entire rule set

          <para>BLACKLISTNEWONLY=No is not permitted with FASTACCEPT=Yes. This

        <listitem>
          <para>Shorewall-perl has a single rule generator that is used for

      <para>Shorewall-perl is dependent on Perl which has a large disk

      your embedded systems. Shorewall-perl will run on Windows under <ulink

    <para>If you only install one compiler, then that compiler will be

    <para>The value of this new option can be either 'perl' or 'shell'.</para>

    <para>If you add 'SHOREWALL_COMPILER=perl' to
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</filename> then by default, the
    new compiler will be used on the system. If you add it to
    <filename>shorewall.conf</filename> in a separate directory (such as a
    Shorewall-lite export directory) then the new compiler will only be used
    when you compile from that directory.</para>

    <para>If you only install one compiler, it is suggested that you do not
    set SHOREWALL_COMPILER.</para>

    <para>If both compilers are installed, you can select the compiler to use

        <member>'-C shell' means use the shell compiler</member>

        <member>'-C perl' means use the perl compiler</member>

    <para>Example:<programlisting><command>shorewall restart -C perl</command></programlisting></para>

    <para>When the Shorewall-perl compiler has been selected, the

      <para>To create a <ulink url="ManualChains.html">manual chain</ulink>,
      use the new_manual_chain() function. The function accepts a single

      <para>A companion function, <emphasis
