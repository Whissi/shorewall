    <title>What is Split DNS</title>

    <para><firstterm>Split DNS</firstterm> is simply a configuration in which
    the IP address to which a DNS name resolves is dependent on where the
    client is. It is most often used in a NAT environment to insure that
    lodcal clients resolve server names to their local RFC 1918 addresses
    while external clients resolve the same server names to their public
    counterparts.</para>

    <title>Setting up Split DNS</title>

    <para>Setting up Split DNS is extremely simple:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Be sure that your firewall/router can resolve external DNS
        names.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Install the <emphasis role="bold">dnsmasq</emphasis> package and
        arrange for it to start at boot time. There are many dnsmasq HOWTOs on
        the Internet.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Add your local hosts to <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> on the
        firewall/router using their local RFC 1918 addresses. Here's an
        example:<programlisting>#
# hosts         This file describes a number of hostname-to-address
#               mappings for the TCP/IP subsystem.  It is mostly
#               used at boot time, when no name servers are running.
#               On small systems, this file can be used instead of a
#               "named" name server.
# Syntax:
#    
# IP-Address  Full-Qualified-Hostname  Short-Hostname
#

127.0.0.1       localhost

# special IPv6 addresses

        <para>Configure your local network hosts to use the firewall/router as
        their DNS server. If your local hosts are configured using DHCP, that
        is a simple one-line change to the DHCP configuration.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">And that's it!</emphasis> Your local clients
    will resolve those names in the firewall/router's
    <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file as defined in that file. All other
    names will be resolved using the firewall/router's Name Server as defined
    in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <para>From an Internet Host:<programlisting>gateway:~ # host linksys
linksys.shorewall.net has address 206.124.146.180
gateway:~ # </programlisting></para>

    <para>From ubuntu (192.168.0.3):<programlisting>teastep@ubuntu:~$ host linksys
linksys.shorewall.net has address 172.20.1.1
