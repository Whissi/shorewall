    <title>Overview of Shorewall Macros?</title>

    <para>Shorewall macros allow a symbolic name to be associated with a
    series of one or more iptables rules. The symbolic name may appear in the
    ACTION column of an <filename><ulink
    url="manpages/shorewall-rules.html">/etc/shorewall/rules</ulink></filename>
    file entry and in the TARGET column of an action in which case, the
    traffic matching that rules file entry will be passed to the series of
    iptables rules named by the macro.</para>

    <para>Macros can be thought of as templates. When a macro is invoked in an
    <filename>/etc/shorewall/rules</filename> entry, it may be qualified by a
    logging specification (log level and optionally a log tag). The presence
    of the log level/tag causes a modified series of rules to be generated in
    which each packet/rule match within the macro causes a log message to be
    generated.</para>

    <para>There are two types of Shorewall macros:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Standard Macros. These macros are released as part of Shorewall.
        They are defined in macros.* files in <filename
        class="directory">/usr/share/shorewall</filename>. Each
        <filename>macros.*</filename> file has a comment at the beginning of
        the file that describes what the macro does. As an example, here is
        the definition of the <firstterm>SMB</firstterm> standard
        macro.</para>

        <programlisting>#
# Shorewall 3.0 /usr/share/shorewall/macro.SMB

#       Handle Microsoft SMB traffic. You need to invoke this macro in
#       both directions.

#LAST LINE -- ADD YOUR ENTRIES BEFORE THIS ONE -- DO NOT REMOVE</programlisting>

        <para>If you wish to modify one of the standard macros, do not modify
        the definition in <filename
        class="directory">/usr/share/shorewal</filename>l. Rather, copy the
        file to <filename class="directory">/etc/shorewall</filename> (or
        somewhere else on your CONFIG_PATH) and modify the copy.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>User-defined Macros. These macros are created by end-users. They
        are defined in macros.* files in /etc/shorewall or in another
        directory listed in your CONFIG_PATH (defined in <ulink
        url="manpages/shorewall.conf.html">/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf</ulink>).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Most Standard Macros are <firstterm>parameterized</firstterm>. That
    means that you specify what you want to do (ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, etc.)
    when you invoke the macro. The SMB macro shown above is parameterized
    (note PARAM in the TARGET column).</para>

    <para>When invoking a parameterized macro, you follow the name of the
    macro with the action that you want to substitute for PARAM enclosed in
    parentheses.</para>

    <para>Example:</para>

    <blockquote>
      <para>/etc/shorewall/rules:</para>

      <programlisting>#ACTION      SOURCE        DEST         PROTO   DEST PORT(S)
SMB(ACCEPT)  loc           fw         </programlisting>

      <para>The above is equivalent to coding the following series of
      rules:</para>

      <programlisting>#TARGET      SOURCE        DEST         PROTO   DEST PORT(s)
ACCEPT       loc           fw           udp     135,445
ACCEPT       loc           fw           udp     137:139
ACCEPT       loc           fw           udp     1024:   137
ACCEPT       loc           fw           tcp     135,139,445</programlisting>
    </blockquote>

    <para>Logging is covered in <link linkend="Logging">a following
    section</link>. The other columns are treated as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>SOURCE and DEST</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>If a value other than "-" appears in both the macro body and
          in the invocation of the macro, then the value in the invocation is
          examined and the appropriate action is taken. If the value in the
          invocation appears to be an address (IP or MAC) or the name of an
          ipset, then it is placed after the value in the macro body.
          Otherwise, it is placed before the value in the macro body.</para>

          <para>Example 1:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <para>/etc/shorewall/macro.SMTP</para>

            <para>This would be equivalent to coding the following directly in

          </blockquote>

          <para>You may also specify SOURCE or DEST in the SOURCE and DEST
          columns. This allows you to define macros that work in both
          directions.</para>

        LOG, QUEUE, PARAM or an action name. Note that a macro may not invoke
        another macro.</para>

        <simplelist>
          <member>ACCEPT - allow the connection request</member>

          <member>ACCEPT+ - like ACCEPT but also excludes the connection from
          any subsequent DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] rules.</member>

          <member>NONAT - Excludes the connection from any subsequent DNAT[-]
          or REDIRECT[-] rules but doesn't generate a rule to accept the
          traffic.</member>

          <member>DROP - ignore the request</member>

          <member>REJECT - disallow the request and return an icmp unreachable
          or an RST packet.</member>

          <member>DNAT - Forward the request to another address (and
          optionally another port).</member>

          <member>DNAT- - Advanced users only. Like DNAT but only generates
          the DNAT iptables rule and not the companion ACCEPT rule.</member>

          <member>SAME - Similar to DNAT except that the port may not be
          remapped and when multiple server addresses are listed, all requests
          from a given remote system go to the same server.</member>

          <member>SAME- - Advanced users only. Like SAME but only generates
          the SAME iptables rule and not the companion ACCEPT rule.</member>

          <member>REDIRECT - Redirect the request to a local port on the
          firewall.</member>

          <member>REDIRECT- - Advanced users only. Like REDIRECT but only
          generates the REDIRECT iptables rule and not the companion ACCEPT
          rule.</member>

          <member>CONTINUE - (For experts only). Do not process any of the
          following rules for this (source zone,destination zone). If The
          source and/or destination If the address falls into a zone defined

        <para>The ACTION may optionally be followed by ":" and a syslog log

        and must use <quote>-</quote> as a separator.</para>

        <para>Alternatively, clients may be specified by interface name. For
        example, eth1 specifies a client that communicates with the firewall

      <listitem>
        <para>ORIGINAL DEST (Shorewall-perl 4.2.0 and later)</para>

        <para>To use this column, you must include 'FORMAT 2' as the first
        non-comment line in your macro file.</para>

        <para>If ACTION is DNAT[-] or REDIRECT[-] then if this column is
        included and is different from the IP address given in the DEST
        column, then connections destined for that address will be forwarded
        to the IP and port specified in the DEST column.</para>

        <para>A comma-separated list of addresses may also be used. This is
        most useful with the REDIRECT target where you want to redirect
        traffic destined for particular set of hosts. Finally, if the list of
        addresses begins with "!" (exclusion) then the rule will be followed
        only if the original destination address in the connection request
        does not match any of the addresses listed.</para>

        <para>For other actions, this column may be included and may contain
        one or more addresses (host or network) separated by commas. Address
        ranges are not allowed. When this column is supplied, rules are
        generated that require that the original destination address matches
        one of the listed addresses. This feature is most useful when you want
        to generate a filter rule that corresponds to a DNAT- or REDIRECT-
        rule. In this usage, the list of addresses should not begin with
        "!".</para>

        specifying CONNLIMIT, the number of current connections is calculated
        over all current connections from the SOURCE host. By default, the
        <replaceable>limit</replaceable> is applied to each host but can be
        made to apply to networks of hosts by specifying a
        <replaceable>mask</replaceable>. The mask specifies the width of a

        <para>Macros are expanded in-line while each action is its own chain.
        So if there are a lot of rules involved in your new action/macro then
        it is generally better to use an action than a macro. Only the packets
        selected when you invoke the action are directed to the corresponding
        chain. On the other hand, if there are only one or two rules involved
        in what you want to do then a macro is more efficient.</para>
