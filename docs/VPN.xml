    <title>Virtual Private Networking (VPN)</title>

    <para>It is often the case that a system behind the firewall needs to be
    able to access a remote network through Virtual Private Networking (VPN).
    The two most common means for doing this are IPSEC and PPTP. The basic
    setup is shown in the following diagram:</para>

    <graphic fileref="images/VPN.png" />

    <para>A system with an RFC 1918 address needs to access a remote network
    through a remote gateway. For this example, we will assume that the local
    system has IP address 192.168.1.12 and that the remote gateway has IP
    address 192.0.2.224.</para>

    <para>If PPTP is being used, there are no firewall requirements beyond the
    default loc-&gt;net ACCEPT policy. There is one restriction however: Only
    one local system at a time can be connected to a single remote gateway
    unless you patch your kernel from the <quote>Patch-o-matic</quote> patches
    available at <ulink
    url="http://www.netfilter.org">http://www.netfilter.org</ulink>.</para>

    <para>If IPSEC is being used, you should configure IPSEC to use
    <firstterm>NAT Traversal</firstterm> -- Under NAT traversal the IPSEC
    packets (protocol 50 or 51) are encapsulated in UDP packets with
    destination port 4500. Additionally, <firstterm>keep-alive
    messages</firstterm> are sent frequently so that NATing gateways between
    the end-points will retain their connection-tracking entries. This is the
    way that I connect to the HP Intranet and it works flawlessly without
    anything in Shorewall other than my ACCEPT loc-&gt;net policy. NAT
    traversal is available as a patch for Windows 2K and is a standard feature
    of Windows XP -- simply select "L2TP IPSec VPN" from the "Type of VPN"
    pulldown.</para>

    <para>Alternatively, if IPSEC is being used then you can try the
    following: only one system may connect to the remote gateway and there are
    firewall configuration requirements as follows:</para>

    <para>The above may or may not work — your milage may vary. NAT Traversal
    is definitely a better solution. To use NAT traversal:<table id="Table2">

    <para>If you want to be able to give access to all of your local systems
    to the remote network, you should consider running a VPN client on your
    firewall. As starting points, see <ulink
